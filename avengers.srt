2
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:17,340
Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

3
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:19,473
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:20,406
Okay.

5
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:22,542
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

6
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:25,174
Gotta move
your foot here.

7
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:26,975
Point your toe this way.

8
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:28,773
Your hips here.

9
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,242
Okay?

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,306
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,440
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,974
How about now?
Can you see now?

13
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:36,506
- No.
- How about now?

14
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:39,642
All right.

15
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:42,308
Ready? Three fingers.

16
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,208
Nice!

17
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,273
Nice throw, kiddo.

18
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:48,640
Here you go.

19
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:51,007
Hey, you guys
want mayo? Or mustard?

20
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,807
Or both?

21
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,907
Who puts mayo
on a hot dog?

22
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,007
Probably your brothers.

23
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:58,139
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

24
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,707
Got it!

25
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,341
Nate, mayo or mustard?

26
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,405
How about ketchup?

27
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,807
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

28
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:06,875
Mind your elbow.

29
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:11,040
Good job, hawk-eye.

30
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:13,809
Go get your arrow.

31
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,040
Hey, guys!

32
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,539
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

33
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,505
All right.

34
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,141
We're coming.
We're hungry.

35
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,641
Lila, let's go.

36
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:28,874
Lila?

37
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:32,808
Honey?

38
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,774
Hey, babe?

40
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,674
Babe?

41
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,140
Babe?

42
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:54,808
Boys!

43
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:57,608
Boys!

44
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:01,105
Laura!

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,404
You don't need
to do that.

46
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:49,339
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

47
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,738
Oh, yeah.

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,438
That was close.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,370
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

50
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,873
I would like to try again.

51
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,771
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

52
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,337
It's fun.

53
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,539
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,740
And you've won.

55
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,072
Congratulations.

56
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:12,372
Fair game.

57
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,138
Good sport.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,439
You have fun?

59
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:21,238
It was fun.

60
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,339
This thing on?

61
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,472
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

62
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,437
If you find this recording...

63
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,302
don't post it on social media.

64
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,604
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

65
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,269
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

66
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,937
I don't even know
if you're still...

67
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,839
Oh, God, I hope so.

68
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,037
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

69
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,770
<i>No, uh, 22.</i>

70
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:14,536
<i>You know, if it wasn't for
the existential terror...</i>

71
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,736
<i>of staring into
the literal void of space,</i>

72
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,269
<i>I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.</i>

73
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,636
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

74
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,937
<i>thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

75
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,736
<i>Oh, you'd love her.</i>

76
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,436
<i>Very practical.</i>

77
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,705
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

78
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,703
<i>So, the fuel cells were
cracked during battle...</i>

79
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,970
<i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i>

80
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:41,136
<i>and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.</i>

81
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:46,168
<i>Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.</i>

82
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,771
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

83
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,671
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

84
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:56,805
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

85
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:03,234
<i>Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...</i>

86
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,069
<i>but I gotta say
I was really hoping</i>

87
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,035
<i>to pull off one last one.</i>

88
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:09,134
<i>But it looks like...</i>

89
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,170
<i>Well, you know
what it looks like.</i>

90
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:14,301
Don't feel bad about this.

91
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:17,936
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

92
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:21,236
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

93
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,201
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

94
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,370
Go rest my eyes.

95
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,768
Please know...

96
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,802
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

97
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:42,770
I'm fine. Totally fine.

98
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:44,737
I dream about you.

99
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:47,870
Because it's always you.

100
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,631
Couldn't stop him.

101
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,763
Neither could I.

102
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,099
Hang on.

103
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:18,099
I lost the kid.

104
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,199
Tony, we lost.

105
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,433
Is, uh...?

106
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,132
- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!

107
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,666
Oh, my God!

108
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,265
It's okay.

109
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,832
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

110
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:50,897
World governments
are in pieces.

111
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,863
The parts that are
still working...

112
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:56,633
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

113
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,030
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

114
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,298
Thanos wiped out...

115
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:07,764
...50% of all
living creatures.

116
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:14,096
Where is he now? Where?

117
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,796
We don't know.

118
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:19,265
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

119
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:22,798
What's wrong with him?

120
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:25,963
Oh, he's pissed.

121
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,432
He thinks he failed.

122
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:29,929
Which, of course, he did...

123
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,162
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

124
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,563
Honestly,
until this exact second

125
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:34,996
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

126
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,396
Maybe I am.

127
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,029
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

128
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,228
Deep space scans...

129
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,398
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

130
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,095
Tony, you fought him.

131
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:46,297
Who told you that?

132
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:47,996
I didn't fight him.

133
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,597
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

134
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,996
while the Bleecker Street
magician

135
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,262
gave away the store.

136
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:53,495
That's what happened.

137
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:54,829
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

138
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:57,696
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

139
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,230
Uh...

140
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:02,162
I saw this coming
a few years back.

141
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,262
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

142
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,963
Thought I was dreaming.

143
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,095
Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.

144
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:09,029
And I needed you.

145
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,228
As in, past tense.

146
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,728
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

147
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,395
Sorry.

148
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:19,095
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

149
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:21,695
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

150
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:22,661
Tony, Tony!

151
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:26,228
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

152
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,195
was a suit of armor
around the world.

153
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:29,429
Remember that?

154
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,062
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

155
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:33,395
That's what we needed.

156
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,761
Well, that didn't
work out, did it?

157
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,227
I said we'd lose.

158
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,995
You said, "We'll do that
together, too."

159
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,395
And guess what, Cap?

160
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:41,995
We lost.

161
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,196
And you weren't there.

162
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:45,761
But that's what
we do, right?

163
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,661
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

164
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:50,962
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

165
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,094
- Okay.
- Right?

166
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:53,361
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

167
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:54,661
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

168
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,127
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

169
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,761
We need you.
You're new blood.

170
00:11:57,763 --> 00:12:00,962
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

171
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:02,328
I got no coordinates...

172
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,261
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

173
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:07,161
Zero. Zip. Nada.

174
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:09,163
No trust, liar.

175
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:14,927
Here, take this.

176
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:17,229
You find him,
you put that on...

177
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,229
you hide.

178
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,361
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

179
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:24,129
Let me...

180
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,727
Bruce gave him
a sedative.

181
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,662
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

182
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,226
You guys
take care of him...

183
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:37,862
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

184
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,660
Where are you going?

185
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:41,395
To kill Thanos.

186
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,460
Hey.

187
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:47,694
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

188
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,560
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

189
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,160
We realize up there
is more your territory,

190
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,360
but this is
our fight, too.

191
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:54,827
You even know
where he is?

192
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,093
I know people who might.

193
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,561
Don't bother.

194
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,329
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

195
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:06,226
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

196
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:10,393
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

197
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:13,793
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

198
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,559
I'd ask...

199
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,893
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

200
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,095
And his answer
was always the same.

201
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:26,593
"To the Garden."

202
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,693
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

203
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:31,360
So, where is he?

204
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,593
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

205
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,859
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

206
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:37,826
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

207
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:40,125
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

208
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:41,595
Until two days ago...

209
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:45,127
on this planet.

210
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:47,294
Thanos is there.

211
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,826
He used the stones again.

212
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,491
Hey, hey, hey.

213
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:54,592
We'd be going in
shorthanded, you know?

214
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:56,225
Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

215
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:57,993
So, let's get 'em.

216
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,625
Use them to bring
everyone back.

217
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:00,826
Just like that?

218
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,426
Yeah. Just like that.

219
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:05,692
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

220
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,792
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

221
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,359
If we do this,
how do we know

222
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:12,892
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

223
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,594
Because before
you didn't have me.

224
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:16,558
Hey, new girl?

225
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,159
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

226
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,326
And if you don't mind
my asking,

227
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,592
where the hell
have you been all this time?

228
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,758
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

229
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,860
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

230
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,627
I like this one.

231
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,626
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

232
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:19,757
Okay.

233
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,260
Who here hasn't been
to space?

234
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,591
Why?

235
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:26,657
You better not throw up
on my ship.

236
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,092
Approaching jump in three...

237
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,293
two, one.

238
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,491
<i>I'll head down for recon.</i>

239
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,556
This is gonna work, Steve.

240
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,225
I know it will.

241
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:13,590
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

242
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:17,324
<i>No satellites.
No ships. No armies.</i>

243
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,125
<i>No ground defenses
of any kind.</i>

244
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:22,725
<i>It's just him.</i>

245
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,225
And that's enough.

246
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,356
Oh, no.

247
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:06,521
Where are they?

248
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:08,523
Answer the question.

249
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,387
The universe
required correction.

250
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:17,521
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

251
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:19,155
beyond temptation.

252
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:22,087
You murdered trillions!

253
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,523
You should be grateful.

254
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,988
Where are the stones?

255
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,621
Gone.

256
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,219
Reduced to atoms.

257
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,955
You used them two days ago!

258
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:38,322
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

259
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:40,623
It nearly killed me.

260
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:44,087
But the work is done.

261
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,823
It always will be.

262
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:51,790
I am inevitable.

263
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,453
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

264
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,823
My father
is many things.

265
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,789
A liar is not one of them.

266
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,156
Ah.

267
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,255
Thank you, daughter.

268
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,089
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

269
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,488
What?

270
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,822
What did you do?

271
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,288
I went for the head.

272
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,286
<i>So...</i>

273
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:41,053
...I, uh, went on a date
the other day.

274
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,919
It's the first time
in five years.

275
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:45,386
You know? I'm sitting there
at dinner.

276
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:48,553
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

277
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:51,384
What did you talk about?

278
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:54,854
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

279
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:57,253
My job, his job.

280
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:00,153
How much we miss the Mets.

281
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:04,119
And then things got quiet...

282
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:09,818
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

283
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,420
What about you?

284
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:15,687
I cried just before dessert.

285
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:21,587
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

286
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:23,451
That's great.

287
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,250
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

288
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:28,051
You didn't know where
you were gonna come down.

289
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,017
And that's it.
That's those little

290
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,418
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

291
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,385
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

292
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,551
I went in the ice in '45,

293
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:42,252
right after I met
the love of my life.

294
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:44,753
Woke up 70 years later.

295
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:50,085
You gotta move on.

296
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,352
Gotta move on.

297
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,684
The world is in our hands.

298
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:03,884
It's left to us, guys.

299
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:06,252
And we gotta do
something with it.

300
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:08,352
Otherwise...

301
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:11,852
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

302
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,217
What the hell?

303
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:28,718
Hope?

304
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,982
Kid!

305
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,216
Hey, kid!

306
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,650
What the hell happened here?

307
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,182
Oh, my God!

308
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,547
Oh, please!

309
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,113
Please, please!

310
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,316
No, no, no. No.

311
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:55,182
No.

312
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,581
Excuse me. Sorry.

313
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,948
Oh, Cassie, no.

314
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,516
No, no, no.

315
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,314
No, no.

316
00:25:05,316 --> 00:25:08,449
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

317
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,749
What?

318
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:48,248
Cassie?

319
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,682
Dad?

320
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:19,213
You're so big!

321
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:33,580
<i>Yeah. We boarded</i>

322
00:26:33,582 --> 00:26:36,979
<i>that highly-suspect
warship Danvers pinged.</i>

323
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:38,879
<i>It was an infectious
garbage scow.</i>

324
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,378
<i>So, thanks
for the hot tip.</i>

325
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,779
<i>Well, you were closer.</i>

326
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,345
<i>Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.</i>

327
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:44,745
You get a reading
on those tremors?

328
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:47,545
<i>'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.</i>

329
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:49,912
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

330
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,412
<i>Nat.</i>

331
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:53,512
<i>It's an earthquake
under the ocean.</i>

332
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:57,178
<i>We handle it
by not handling it.</i>

333
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,844
Carol, are we seeing you
here next month?

334
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:00,978
<i>Not likely.</i>

335
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,744
<i>What? You gonna get
another haircut?</i>

336
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,145
<i>Listen, fur face.</i>

337
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:06,111
<i>I'm covering
a lot of territory.</i>

338
00:27:06,113 --> 00:27:08,011
<i>The things that are
happening on Earth</i>

339
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:09,678
<i>are happening
everywhere.</i>

340
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,478
<i>On thousands of planets.</i>

341
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,144
<i>All right, all right.
That's a good point.</i>

342
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,345
<i>That's a good point.</i>

343
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:16,614
<i>So, you might not see me
for a long time.</i>

344
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,212
All right. Uh, well...

345
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,144
This channel's
always active.

346
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:24,344
So, if anything
goes sideways...

347
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:27,011
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

348
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,210
comes through me.

349
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:29,978
<i>Okay.</i>

350
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,547
All right.

351
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:33,413
<i>Good luck.</i>

352
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,011
Where are you?

353
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:44,144
<i>Mexico.</i>

354
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:46,978
<i>The Federales found
a room full of bodies.</i>

355
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,611
<i>Looks like a bunch
of cartel guys...</i>

356
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,911
<i>never even had a chance
to get their guns off.</i>

357
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,810
It's probably a rival gang.

358
00:27:52,812 --> 00:27:54,177
<i>Except it isn't.</i>

359
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,910
<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>

360
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,511
<i>What he's done here...</i>

361
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:02,511
<i>what he's been doing
for the last few years...</i>

362
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,546
<i>I mean, the scene
that he left...</i>

363
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:06,643
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

364
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,179
<i>there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.</i>

365
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,845
Will you find out
where he's going next?

366
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,078
<i>Nat?</i>

367
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:25,479
Please?

368
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:28,412
<i>Okay.</i>

369
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,176
You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

370
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,845
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

371
00:28:44,912 --> 00:28:46,577
You here
to do your laundry?

372
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,245
And to see a friend.

373
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,844
Clearly, your friend is fine.

374
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:55,943
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

375
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,176
when I was coming over
the bridge.

376
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:59,176
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

377
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:00,510
cleaner water.

378
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:02,676
You know, if you're
about to tell me

379
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:04,809
to look on the bright side...

380
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,178
Um...

381
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,310
I'm about to hit you
in the head

382
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:10,676
with a peanut butter sandwich.

383
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:11,678
Hmm.

384
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:13,842
Sorry.

385
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:15,177
Force of habit.

386
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:30,776
You know,
I keep telling everybody

387
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,742
they should move on...

388
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:34,344
and grow.

389
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:36,744
Some do.

390
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,710
But not us.

391
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,842
If I move on, who does this?

392
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:47,144
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

393
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,511
I used to have nothing.

394
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,577
And then I got this.

395
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,577
This job.

396
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:04,677
This family.

397
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,411
And I was better
because of it.

398
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:22,243
And even though
they're gone...

399
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,543
I'm still trying to be better.

400
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:34,109
I think we both
need to get a life.

401
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:37,777
You first.

402
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:44,607
<i>Oh, hi, hi!</i>

403
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,908
<i>Uh, is anyone home?</i>

404
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,607
<i>This is, uh, Scott Lang.</i>

405
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:50,807
<i>We met a few years ago
at the airport...</i>

406
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,473
<i>in Germany?</i>

407
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,840
<i>I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.</i>

408
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:56,574
- <i>You wouldn't recognize me.</i>
- Is this an old message?

409
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:59,874
<i>Ant-Man?
I know you know that.</i>

410
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:01,073
It's the front gate.

411
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:02,607
<i>I really need
to talk to you guys.</i>

412
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:09,809
Scott.

413
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:11,907
Are you okay?

414
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:13,108
Yeah.

415
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:17,374
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

416
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,175
Only to make
conversation.

417
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:22,041
All right, so...

418
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:24,809
five years ago,
right before...

419
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:26,674
Thanos...

420
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,874
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

421
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:31,807
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

422
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:34,041
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

423
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:35,676
Hope. She's my, um...

424
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:39,508
She was my...

425
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:42,373
She was supposed
to pull me out.

426
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,173
And then Thanos happened...

427
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:46,273
and I got stuck in there.

428
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,373
I'm sorry, that must have
been a very long five years.

429
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,974
Yeah, but that's just it.

430
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,240
It wasn't.

431
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,539
For me, it was five hours.

432
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:54,073
See, the rules
of the quantum realm

433
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:55,206
aren't like
they are up here.

434
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,973
Everything is unpredictable.

435
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:58,472
Is that anybody's sandwich?

436
00:31:58,474 --> 00:31:59,675
I'm starving.

437
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:01,173
Scott.

438
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:02,608
What are you
talking about?

439
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:04,808
So...

440
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:08,139
what I'm saying is...

441
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,806
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

442
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,573
The only problem is
right now

443
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:14,172
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

444
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:15,973
But what if we did?

445
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,205
I can't stop thinking
about it.

446
00:32:17,207 --> 00:32:19,272
What if we could somehow
control the chaos...

447
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:20,706
and we could navigate it?

448
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,239
What if there was a way...

449
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,006
that we could enter
the quantum realm

450
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,205
at a certain point in time...

451
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:26,839
but then exit
the quantum realm

452
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:28,105
at another point in time?

453
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:30,172
Like...

454
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:32,371
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

455
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,172
Are you talking
about a time machine?

456
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:37,105
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

457
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:38,341
This is more like a...

458
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,239
Yeah. Like a time machine.

459
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:44,139
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

460
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:46,505
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

461
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,707
There's gotta be...

462
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:49,872
some way...

463
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:51,838
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

464
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,205
I get emails from a raccoon...

465
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:56,005
so nothing sounds crazy
anymore.

466
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,274
So, who do we talk to
about this?

467
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:17,540
Chow time!

468
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,140
Maguna.

469
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:26,674
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

470
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:28,772
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

471
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,173
- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

472
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:32,972
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

473
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:34,537
That is part of a special
anniversary gift

474
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:35,606
I'm making for Mom.

475
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:41,805
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

476
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:44,071
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

477
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,972
- No.
- That's what you want.

478
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:48,204
How did you find this?

479
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,204
- Garage.
- Really?

480
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:52,406
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

481
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:55,138
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

482
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,071
You like going in
the garage, huh?

483
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:58,871
So does Daddy.

484
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:02,139
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

485
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:06,105
So, I'm gonna...

486
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:26,004
No. We know
what it sounds like.

487
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:27,103
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

488
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,403
is anything really
impossible?

489
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:30,469
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

490
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,269
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

491
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,636
Can we agree on that?

492
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,804
Thank you.

493
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,203
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

494
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,536
- I did.
- No.

495
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:40,503
You accidentally survived.

496
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,770
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

497
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:46,238
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

498
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:49,469
A time heist?

499
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:51,836
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

500
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,137
Why didn't we think
of this before?

501
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,770
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

502
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:57,970
The stones are in the past.

503
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,369
We could go back,
we could get them.

504
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:01,736
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

505
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:04,003
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

506
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,469
I don't believe we would.

507
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:09,003
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

508
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:10,903
However, high hopes
won't help...

509
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:12,937
if there's no logical,
tangible way

510
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:16,436
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

511
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,402
I believe
the most likely outcome

512
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:19,736
will be our
collective demise.

513
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:22,468
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

514
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,268
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

515
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,037
no betting
on sporting events.

516
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,838
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

517
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,136
Are you seriously
telling me

518
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:33,102
that your plan
to save the universe...

519
00:35:33,104 --> 00:35:34,838
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

520
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,870
- Is it?
- No.

521
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:38,970
Good. You had me
worried there.

522
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,136
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

523
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,702
That's not how
quantum physics works.

524
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:43,837
Tony.

525
00:35:45,804 --> 00:35:47,902
We have to take a stand.

526
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:49,804
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

527
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:53,902
I know you got
a lot on the line.

528
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:56,468
You got a wife, a daughter.

529
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,201
But I lost someone
very important to me.

530
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,802
A lotta people did.

531
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:04,135
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

532
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:05,335
to bring everyone back,

533
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,002
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

534
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,837
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

535
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,936
I can't.

536
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,535
Mommy told me
to come and save you.

537
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:19,467
Good job. I'm saved.

538
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,769
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

539
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:22,769
Anything else.

540
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:24,835
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

541
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, look, the table's
set for six.

542
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:27,936
Tony. I get it.

543
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,369
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

544
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:33,167
But this is a second chance.

545
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,835
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

546
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:37,469
Can't roll the dice on it.

547
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:41,469
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

548
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,568
Well, he's scared.

549
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,568
He's not wrong.

550
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,868
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

551
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,303
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

552
00:36:52,038 --> 00:36:54,236
No, I wanna do it right.

553
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:59,135
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

554
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:01,701
Bigger than his?

555
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,634
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

556
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:04,734
Try some of that.

557
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,133
Have some eggs.

558
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:07,501
I'm so confused.

559
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:09,334
These are confusing times.

560
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:11,401
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

561
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:14,201
Nah, I get it.
I'm kidding!

562
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,634
I know, it's crazy.

563
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:17,935
I'm wearing shirts now.

564
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:21,166
Yeah. What? How? Why?

565
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:24,133
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

566
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,968
Except it was worse
for me...

567
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,266
'cause I lost twice.

568
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,302
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

569
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:31,333
and then, we all lost.

570
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:32,868
No one blamed you, Bruce.

571
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,368
I did.

572
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,233
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

573
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:38,600
like he's some kind
of disease...

574
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:40,567
something to get rid of.

575
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:43,968
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

576
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,199
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

577
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,000
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

578
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,402
and now, look at me.

579
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,300
Best of both worlds.

580
00:37:53,302 --> 00:37:54,900
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

581
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:56,700
Can we get a photo?

582
00:37:56,702 --> 00:37:58,833
100%, little person.

583
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,433
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

584
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:03,500
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

585
00:38:03,502 --> 00:38:05,098
Say "green."

586
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,567
- Green.
- Green.

587
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:08,700
Did you get that?

588
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,533
That's a good one.

589
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:13,134
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

590
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,465
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

591
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:19,700
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

592
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:21,700
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

593
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:22,633
Stranger danger.

594
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:24,332
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

595
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,599
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

596
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:26,767
But come on. The kid...

597
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,232
I don't want a picture
with them.

598
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:29,432
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

599
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,632
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

600
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,332
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

601
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:34,632
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

602
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:35,867
Okay.

603
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,265
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

604
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,033
No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

605
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:40,666
Hulk out!

606
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:41,701
Bruce.

607
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:43,299
Dab.

608
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,499
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

609
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:46,632
She knows better.

610
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,499
About what we were saying.

611
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:49,668
Right.

612
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:54,367
The whole time travel
do-over?

613
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:59,766
Eh, guys, it's outside
of my area of expertise.

614
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:01,799
Well, you pulled this off.

615
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:05,834
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

616
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:40,531
I've got a mild inspiration.

617
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,032
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

618
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:44,164
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

619
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,964
before we pack it in
for the night.

620
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,031
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

621
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,598
inverted, please.

622
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,667
<i>Processing.</i>

623
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:57,765
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

624
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,698
factoring in spectral decomp.

625
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,698
- That'll take a second.
- <i>Just a moment.</i>

626
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,800
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

627
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:08,865
<i>Model rendered.</i>

628
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:21,931
Shit!

629
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,332
Shit!

630
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,063
What are you
doing up, little miss?

631
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,964
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

632
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,263
Only Mommy says that word.

633
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:33,931
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

634
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,163
Why are you up?

635
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,664
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

636
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:37,931
Why do you think?

637
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,430
No, I got something
on my mind.

638
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:41,031
I got something on my mind.

639
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,666
Was it juice pops?

640
00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:45,465
Sure was.

641
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:48,730
That's extortion.
That's a word.

642
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:49,996
What kind you want?

643
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,130
Great minds think alike.

644
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,198
Juice pops exactly...

645
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:56,432
was on my mind.

646
00:40:57,766 --> 00:40:59,064
You done? Yeah?

647
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,666
Now you are.

648
00:41:01,164 --> 00:41:02,465
Here. Wipe.

649
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,896
Good. That face
goes there.

650
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,430
Tell me a story.

651
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:10,830
A story.

652
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:13,630
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

653
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,062
That is a horrible story.

654
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:17,064
Come on, that's
your favorite story.

655
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:18,766
Love you tons.

656
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:22,631
I love you 3,000.

657
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:24,831
Wow.

658
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:35,197
3,000.
That's crazy.

659
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:38,197
Go to bed or I'll sell
all your toys.

660
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,763
Night night.

661
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,329
Not that it's a competition...

662
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,596
but she loves me 3,000.

663
00:41:44,598 --> 00:41:45,596
Does she, now?

664
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:48,895
You were somewhere
in the low 6 to 900 range.

665
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:56,962
Whatcha reading?

666
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:58,663
Just a book on composting.

667
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:00,731
What's new with composting?

668
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:04,330
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

669
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,398
By the way.

670
00:42:07,096 --> 00:42:08,328
And, you know,

671
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,729
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

672
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,297
Time travel.

673
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,698
What?

674
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:19,063
Wow.

675
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,564
That's amazing...

676
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,762
and terrifying.

677
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:28,330
That's right.

678
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:37,461
We got really lucky.

679
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:38,595
Yeah.

680
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,827
I know.

681
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:41,094
A lot of people didn't.

682
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,763
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

683
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:45,961
Sorta seems like you can.

684
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,664
Not if I stop.

685
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:51,697
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

686
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,093
Tony...

687
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:55,662
trying to get you to stop...

688
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:58,564
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

689
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,530
Something tells me...

690
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:06,695
I should put it
in a lockbox

691
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:08,497
and drop it to the bottom
of the lake...

692
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:10,829
and go to bed.

693
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:19,362
But would you be able to rest?

694
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:27,527
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

695
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,663
Scott, fire up...

696
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:31,728
the, uh, van thing.

697
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:35,127
Breakers are set.

698
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,127
Emergency generators
are on standby.

699
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:38,760
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

700
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:42,193
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

701
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:45,294
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

702
00:43:45,296 --> 00:43:47,260
You can't say things
like that.

703
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:49,195
It was a bad joke.

704
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,427
You were kidding, right?

705
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,327
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

706
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:57,860
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

707
00:43:57,862 --> 00:43:59,726
We're good!

708
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:01,494
Get your helmet on.

709
00:44:01,496 --> 00:44:03,460
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

710
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:05,226
let you walk around
for an hour,

711
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,960
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

712
00:44:06,962 --> 00:44:08,693
Make sense?

713
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:10,027
Perfectly not confusing.

714
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:12,194
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

715
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:16,662
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

716
00:44:18,795 --> 00:44:20,192
On a count of three...

717
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:24,159
Three, two, one.

718
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:29,593
Uh... Guys?

719
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:31,126
This doesn't feel right.

720
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:32,226
What is this?

721
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:33,259
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

722
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,526
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

723
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:35,528
Yes, it's Scott.

724
00:44:38,228 --> 00:44:40,992
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

725
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:42,059
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

726
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:43,226
Could I get
a little space here?

727
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:44,493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

728
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:45,593
I'm working on it.

729
00:44:52,562 --> 00:44:53,493
It's a baby.

730
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:55,293
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

731
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:56,692
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

732
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,526
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

733
00:44:58,528 --> 00:44:59,727
Oh, my God.

734
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:01,794
And... kill it!

735
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:08,026
Somebody peed my pants.

736
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:09,191
Oh, thank God.

737
00:45:09,193 --> 00:45:12,562
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

738
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:17,794
Or just me me.

739
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:19,494
Time travel!

740
00:45:23,294 --> 00:45:24,294
What?

741
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:28,227
I see this as an absolute win.

742
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,090
Why the long face?

743
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:18,090
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

744
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:20,224
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

745
00:46:20,226 --> 00:46:22,391
It's the EPR Paradox.

746
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:23,657
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

747
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:24,757
you might've wound up...

748
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,224
pushing time through Lang.

749
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:27,391
It's tricky, dangerous.

750
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:29,090
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

751
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:30,391
You did.

752
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:31,690
Oh, did I?

753
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:33,426
Well, thank God
I'm here.

754
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,759
Regardless, I fixed it.

755
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,259
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

756
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:42,525
I just want peace.

757
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:46,792
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

758
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,192
Me, too.

759
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:51,823
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

760
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:53,890
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

761
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:56,290
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

762
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:59,359
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

763
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:03,156
And maybe not die trying.

764
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:04,392
Would be nice.

765
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:07,825
Sounds like a deal.

766
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,622
Tony, I don't know.

767
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:34,256
Why?

768
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:36,223
He made it for you.

769
00:47:36,225 --> 00:47:38,089
Plus, honestly,
I have to get it out of the garage

770
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:40,091
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

771
00:47:45,524 --> 00:47:46,624
Thank you, Tony.

772
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:49,622
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

773
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:51,325
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

774
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:56,289
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

775
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,291
We're working
on that right now.

776
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:17,822
Hey, Humie.

777
00:48:17,824 --> 00:48:19,923
Where's Big Green?

778
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:22,157
The kitchen, I think.

779
00:48:23,157 --> 00:48:24,523
That's awesome.

780
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,889
Rhodey,
careful on re-entry.

781
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:29,657
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

782
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,355
Oh, God.

783
00:48:32,357 --> 00:48:34,590
<i>What's up,
Regular-Sized Man?</i>

784
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:27,854
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

785
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:29,554
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

786
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:31,187
Hey, have a little
compassion, pal.

787
00:49:31,189 --> 00:49:33,288
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

788
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:35,054
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

789
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,887
You shouldn't have come.

790
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:38,556
Ah!

791
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:40,021
Valkyrie!

792
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:42,720
Great to see you,
angry girl!

793
00:49:42,722 --> 00:49:45,290
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

794
00:49:45,956 --> 00:49:47,021
This is Rocket.

795
00:49:47,023 --> 00:49:48,322
How ya doing?

796
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:51,921
He won't see you.

797
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:53,086
It's that bad, huh?

798
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:54,487
We only see him
once a month

799
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:57,789
when he comes
in for "supplies."

800
00:49:58,856 --> 00:50:00,287
It's that bad.

801
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,289
Yeah.

802
00:50:13,689 --> 00:50:14,787
What the...?

803
00:50:17,122 --> 00:50:19,653
Whew! Something died in here!

804
00:50:19,655 --> 00:50:23,519
Hello? Thor!

805
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,053
Are you here
about the cable?

806
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:28,619
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

807
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:31,588
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

808
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:33,388
Thor?

809
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:44,286
Boys! Oh, my God!

810
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:47,288
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

811
00:50:48,454 --> 00:50:49,886
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

812
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:52,719
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

813
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:54,152
That's not necessary.

814
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:57,020
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

815
00:50:57,022 --> 00:50:58,251
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

816
00:50:58,253 --> 00:50:59,786
Long time no see.

817
00:50:59,788 --> 00:51:00,853
Beer's in the bucket.

818
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:02,152
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

819
00:51:02,154 --> 00:51:04,087
No password, obviously.

820
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:06,485
Thor, he's back.

821
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:09,420
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

822
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:11,020
Noobmaster.

823
00:51:11,022 --> 00:51:13,719
Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

824
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:15,786
I am sick of this.

825
00:51:15,788 --> 00:51:17,385
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

826
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:18,752
You know,
the God of Thunder.

827
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:21,119
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

828
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:22,618
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

829
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,351
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

830
00:51:24,353 --> 00:51:27,552
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

831
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:28,485
Oh, that's right, yes!

832
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,587
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

833
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,251
Thank you, Thor.

834
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:33,885
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

835
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:35,718
Thank you very much.
I will.

836
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,418
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

837
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,418
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

838
00:51:42,854 --> 00:51:44,318
Buddy.

839
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,019
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

840
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,385
Why, don't I look all right?

841
00:51:48,387 --> 00:51:49,985
You look like
melted ice cream.

842
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,118
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

843
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,284
- We need your help.
- Mm.

844
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:58,852
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

845
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:00,250
What, like the cable?

846
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:02,752
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

847
00:52:02,754 --> 00:52:03,754
Like Thanos.

848
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:26,384
Don't say that name.

849
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:29,619
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

850
00:52:34,286 --> 00:52:36,386
Please take
your hand off me.

851
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:42,753
Now, I know that guy...

852
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:44,918
might scare you.

853
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,350
Why would I be...?

854
00:52:46,352 --> 00:52:49,617
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

855
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,751
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

856
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:52,951
Hmm.

857
00:52:52,953 --> 00:52:55,052
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

858
00:52:58,385 --> 00:52:59,451
Nope.

859
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:01,085
Didn't think so.

860
00:53:01,953 --> 00:53:03,884
Korg, why don't you,
uh, tell everybody

861
00:53:03,886 --> 00:53:06,216
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

862
00:53:06,218 --> 00:53:07,951
Um, Stormbreaker?

863
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:09,653
Who was swinging
Stormbreaker?

864
00:53:13,518 --> 00:53:16,018
I get it. You're in
a rough spot, okay?

865
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,149
I've been there myself.

866
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:19,716
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

867
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:22,550
Was it Natasha?

868
00:53:22,552 --> 00:53:24,583
It was you.

869
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:26,552
You helped me.

870
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:29,285
So, why don't you ask...

871
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:32,750
the Asgardians down there...

872
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:34,518
how much my help is worth?

873
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,049
The ones that are left,
anyway.

874
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,783
I think we could
bring them back.

875
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:45,652
Stop.

876
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:48,449
Stop, okay?

877
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:49,850
I know you think I'm down here

878
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:51,483
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

879
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:54,248
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

880
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,650
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

881
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:57,950
Oh, we're
good here, mate.

882
00:53:57,952 --> 00:54:00,248
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

883
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,983
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

884
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,250
Goodbye.

885
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,317
We need you, pal.

886
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:19,651
There's beer on the ship.

887
00:54:23,684 --> 00:54:25,384
What kind?

888
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:14,549
What I
want you can't give me.

889
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:39,582
You shouldn't be here.

890
00:56:42,147 --> 00:56:44,147
Neither should you.

891
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,515
I've got a job to do.

892
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:54,682
Is that what
you're calling this?

893
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:56,813
Killing all these people

894
00:56:56,815 --> 00:56:58,281
isn't gonna bring
your family back.

895
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:05,214
We found something.

896
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:09,080
A chance, maybe.

897
00:57:10,948 --> 00:57:13,514
Don't.

898
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:15,814
Don't what?

899
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:20,414
Don't give me hope.

900
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,247
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

901
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:49,378
You're drifting left.

902
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,346
One side there, Lebowski.

903
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:55,878
Ratchet, how's it going?

904
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,177
It's Rocket.

905
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:59,746
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

906
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,246
Time travel suit,
not bad.

907
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:09,077
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

908
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:10,211
I'm being very careful.

909
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:11,812
No, you're being very Hulky.

910
00:58:11,814 --> 00:58:12,945
I'm being careful.

911
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,378
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

912
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,845
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

913
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:17,111
out of existence,
this is it.

914
00:58:17,113 --> 00:58:19,044
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

915
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:21,244
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

916
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:24,545
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

917
00:58:24,547 --> 00:58:25,580
No do-overs.

918
00:58:26,613 --> 00:58:28,079
Plus two test runs.

919
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:32,977
One test run.

920
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,944
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

921
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:37,380
I'm game.

922
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:41,844
I'll do it.

923
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:43,043
Clint,
now you're gonna feel

924
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:44,711
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

925
00:58:44,713 --> 00:58:45,778
Don't worry about that.

926
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,011
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

927
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:48,645
If we can do this,
you know...

928
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:51,444
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

929
00:58:51,446 --> 00:58:52,580
You know, and...

930
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:57,711
First of all,
that's horrible.

931
00:58:57,713 --> 00:58:58,611
It's Thanos.

932
00:58:58,613 --> 00:59:00,977
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

933
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:03,243
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

934
00:59:03,245 --> 00:59:04,810
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

935
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:06,143
before Thanos gets them...

936
00:59:06,145 --> 00:59:09,076
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

937
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,011
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

938
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:12,076
Well, that's what
I heard.

939
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:13,310
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

940
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:15,277
<i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i>

941
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,076
- <i>Time After Time.</i>
- <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

942
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:18,176
<i>Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.</i>

943
00:59:18,178 --> 00:59:19,243
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

944
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:20,343
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

945
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:21,677
<i>Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.</i>

946
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:24,076
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

947
00:59:24,078 --> 00:59:26,076
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

948
00:59:26,078 --> 00:59:27,243
This is known.

949
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:28,677
I don't know why
everyone believes that,

950
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:29,610
but that isn't true.

951
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:31,910
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

952
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:34,310
that past becomes
your future...

953
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:37,410
and your former present
becomes the past...

954
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:40,443
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

955
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:42,075
Exactly.

956
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:45,177
So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?

957
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:50,976
All right, Clint.

958
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:54,342
We're going in three, two...

959
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:55,344
one.

960
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:08,975
Cooper?

961
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:10,674
Where are my headphones?

962
01:01:10,676 --> 01:01:11,807
Lila?

963
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:13,909
- I never had them.
- Lila?

964
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:16,676
Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

965
01:01:17,143 --> 01:01:18,577
Lila! Lila!

966
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:25,176
Yeah, Dad?

967
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:30,109
Dad?

968
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,774
Lila!

969
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,073
Hey. Hey, look at me.

970
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:43,941
You okay?

971
01:01:43,943 --> 01:01:46,175
Yeah. Yeah.

972
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,242
It worked.

973
01:01:50,843 --> 01:01:52,342
It worked.

974
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:57,641
Okay, so the how works.

975
01:01:57,643 --> 01:02:01,541
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

976
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:03,507
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

977
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:05,374
with at least one
of the six Infinity Stones.

978
01:02:05,376 --> 01:02:07,107
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

979
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:08,240
for "damn near been killed"

980
01:02:08,242 --> 01:02:09,908
by one of the six
Infinity Stones.

981
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,107
Well, I haven't...

982
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:12,240
but I don't even know

983
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,573
what the hell
you're all talking about.

984
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:16,740
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

985
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:18,706
for one round-trip each.

986
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:19,740
And these stones have been

987
01:02:19,742 --> 01:02:22,007
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

988
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:23,374
Our history.

989
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:26,507
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

990
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,543
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

991
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:30,309
Correct.

992
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:33,206
So, let's start
with the Aether.

993
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,575
Thor, what do you know?

994
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,339
Is he asleep?

995
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,174
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

996
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,775
Uh, where to start? Um...

997
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,306
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

998
01:02:53,308 --> 01:02:56,306
Someone called it
a stone before.

999
01:02:56,308 --> 01:03:00,806
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1000
01:03:00,808 --> 01:03:02,572
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1001
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:04,072
and stop saying that.

1002
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:06,840
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1003
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:08,873
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1004
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:12,973
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1005
01:03:12,975 --> 01:03:15,506
Ooh.
Scary beings.

1006
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:17,275
So, Jane, actually...

1007
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:19,539
Oh, there she is.

1008
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:23,972
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1009
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:27,339
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1010
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:30,739
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1011
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,505
and she became
very, very sick.

1012
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,672
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1013
01:03:34,674 --> 01:03:35,939
which is where I'm from...

1014
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:38,038
and we had to try
and fix her.

1015
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,672
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1016
01:03:39,674 --> 01:03:43,374
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1017
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:46,674
who's dead and, um...

1018
01:03:48,008 --> 01:03:49,505
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1019
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:51,672
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1020
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,006
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1021
01:03:54,008 --> 01:03:55,305
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1022
01:03:55,307 --> 01:03:57,305
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1023
01:03:57,307 --> 01:03:59,006
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1024
01:03:59,008 --> 01:04:00,540
is impermanence.

1025
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,704
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1026
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,671
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1027
01:04:05,673 --> 01:04:08,839
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1028
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:11,806
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1029
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:14,471
Quill was a person.

1030
01:04:14,473 --> 01:04:17,071
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1031
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:18,471
Oh, look.

1032
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:21,372
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1033
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:24,838
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1034
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,140
I'll take you to space.

1035
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,504
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1036
01:04:29,506 --> 01:04:31,405
What is Vormir?

1037
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:33,305
A dominion of death...

1038
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,407
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1039
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:41,339
It's where Thanos
murdered my sister.

1040
01:04:47,673 --> 01:04:48,706
Not it.

1041
01:04:50,373 --> 01:04:52,137
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

1042
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:54,104
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

1043
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:56,237
Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1044
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:57,771
Nice place
in the Village, though.

1045
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,371
Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1046
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:00,703
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1047
01:05:00,705 --> 01:05:02,237
Wait, he lived
in New York?

1048
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:03,337
No,
he lived in Toronto.

1049
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:04,436
Uh, yeah, on Bleecker
and Sullivan.

1050
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:05,703
Have you been listening
to anything?

1051
01:05:05,705 --> 01:05:06,770
Guys.

1052
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,371
If you pick
the right year,

1053
01:05:08,373 --> 01:05:10,273
there are three stones
in New York.

1054
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:14,405
Shut the front door.

1055
01:05:17,007 --> 01:05:19,237
All right.
We have a plan.

1056
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:24,105
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1057
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:35,572
<i>Five years ago,
we lost.</i>

1058
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:38,272
<i>All of us.</i>

1059
01:05:40,006 --> 01:05:41,505
<i>We lost friends.</i>

1060
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,805
<i>We lost family.</i>

1061
01:05:45,772 --> 01:05:47,639
<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>

1062
01:05:48,805 --> 01:05:51,471
<i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i>

1063
01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:56,336
<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

1064
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:58,471
<i>Get the stones.
Get them back.</i>

1065
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:00,602
One round-trip each.

1066
01:06:00,604 --> 01:06:01,671
No mistakes...

1067
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:03,970
no do-overs.

1068
01:06:03,972 --> 01:06:05,802
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1069
01:06:05,804 --> 01:06:08,071
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1070
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,205
Be careful.

1071
01:06:10,738 --> 01:06:12,138
Look out for each other.

1072
01:06:13,305 --> 01:06:15,337
This is the fight
of our lives...

1073
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,704
and we're gonna win.

1074
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:21,037
Whatever it takes.

1075
01:06:24,037 --> 01:06:25,736
Good luck.

1076
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:26,936
He's pretty good at that.

1077
01:06:26,938 --> 01:06:28,203
- Right?
- All right.

1078
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:29,270
You heard the man.

1079
01:06:29,272 --> 01:06:30,671
Stroke those keys,
Jolly Green.

1080
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:33,702
Trackers engaged.

1081
01:06:33,704 --> 01:06:35,903
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

1082
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:37,502
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
01:06:37,504 --> 01:06:39,334
Okay, I'll do my best.

1084
01:06:39,336 --> 01:06:41,370
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1085
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:45,538
See ya in a minute.

1086
01:07:39,837 --> 01:07:41,201
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1087
01:07:41,203 --> 01:07:43,535
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1088
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:45,701
Stay low. Keep an eye
on the clock.

1089
01:08:01,004 --> 01:08:03,036
Maybe smash a few things
along the way.

1090
01:08:03,937 --> 01:08:06,136
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1091
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:35,133
I'd be careful
going that way.

1092
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:37,035
We just had
the floors waxed.

1093
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:43,802
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1094
01:08:45,268 --> 01:08:49,001
You're about
five years too early.

1095
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:51,166
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1096
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,769
about 20 blocks that way.

1097
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:55,601
What do you want from him?

1098
01:08:56,535 --> 01:08:57,535
That, actually.

1099
01:08:58,501 --> 01:08:59,568
Ah!

1100
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:02,033
I'm afraid not.

1101
01:09:02,035 --> 01:09:03,535
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1102
01:09:04,268 --> 01:09:05,566
You don't want
to do this.

1103
01:09:05,568 --> 01:09:07,199
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1104
01:09:07,201 --> 01:09:08,801
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1105
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:19,468
Let's start over, shall we?

1106
01:09:30,902 --> 01:09:32,432
For you, Lady Jane.

1107
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,065
Um, so you have
anything with pants?

1108
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:36,399
Pants?

1109
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:38,432
Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1110
01:09:38,434 --> 01:09:40,333
- Yes, milady.
- Oh, there's Jane.

1111
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:43,034
All right.

1112
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,833
Here's the deal, tubby.

1113
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:46,966
You're gonna charm her,

1114
01:09:46,968 --> 01:09:48,398
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1115
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,000
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1116
01:09:52,634 --> 01:09:53,799
I'll be right back, okay?

1117
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:55,532
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1118
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:58,565
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1119
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:00,131
I'll see if the scullery
has a couple of to-go cups.

1120
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:02,065
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1121
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,565
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1122
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:11,632
Yes, milady.

1123
01:10:11,634 --> 01:10:12,665
And ask our librarians

1124
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,567
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1125
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,333
Who's the fancy broad?

1126
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,199
That's my mother.

1127
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,367
She dies today.

1128
01:10:28,901 --> 01:10:30,734
Oh, that is today?

1129
01:10:37,165 --> 01:10:40,264
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1130
01:10:40,266 --> 01:10:42,031
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1131
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:43,364
It's a bad idea!

1132
01:10:43,366 --> 01:10:44,531
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

1133
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:47,130
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1134
01:10:47,132 --> 01:10:48,197
Come here. Right here.

1135
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:50,031
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1136
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:51,865
You think you're the
only one who lost people?

1137
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:53,865
What do you think
we're doing here?

1138
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:56,130
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1139
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,798
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1140
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,899
all gone.

1141
01:11:00,901 --> 01:11:02,597
I get you miss
your mom...

1142
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:03,899
but she's gone.

1143
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:05,364
Really gone.

1144
01:11:05,366 --> 01:11:08,564
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1145
01:11:08,566 --> 01:11:09,666
and you can help them.

1146
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,230
So, is it too much to ask

1147
01:11:12,232 --> 01:11:14,063
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1148
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:16,664
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1149
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:19,898
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1150
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,566
and help me
get my family back?

1151
01:11:22,733 --> 01:11:24,531
Okay.

1152
01:11:24,533 --> 01:11:25,533
Are you crying?

1153
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,466
No.

1154
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:30,397
Yes.

1155
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:31,898
I feel like
I'm losing it.

1156
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,964
Get it together!

1157
01:11:32,966 --> 01:11:34,029
You can do this.

1158
01:11:35,098 --> 01:11:36,633
You can do this.

1159
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:40,898
All right?

1160
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,029
Yes, I can.

1161
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,231
Good.

1162
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:47,666
I can do this. I can do this.

1163
01:11:48,532 --> 01:11:50,029
I can't do this.

1164
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:51,997
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1165
01:11:51,999 --> 01:11:53,696
This is our shot.

1166
01:11:53,698 --> 01:11:56,365
Thor? Thor!

1167
01:12:06,398 --> 01:12:07,997
All right,
bring it down, Blue.

1168
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:10,532
Right on that line.
That's it. Down, down.

1169
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,930
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1170
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,128
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1171
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:21,130
All that is really helpful.

1172
01:12:23,097 --> 01:12:24,630
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

1173
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:27,830
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1174
01:12:27,832 --> 01:12:29,496
- Hey.
- We got this.

1175
01:12:29,498 --> 01:12:30,996
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:12:30,998 --> 01:12:32,996
I'll see you back.

1177
01:12:32,998 --> 01:12:34,465
You guys watch
each other's six.

1178
01:12:34,998 --> 01:12:36,397
Yeah.

1179
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:46,564
Coordinates
for Vormir are laid in.

1180
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,197
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1181
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:58,495
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1182
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,729
Okay, so, uh...

1183
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:09,228
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1184
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,297
and then he leads us to the Power
Stone, is that it?

1185
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:13,631
Let's take cover.

1186
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:17,562
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1187
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:19,160
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1188
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,631
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1189
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:25,795
My father...

1190
01:13:25,797 --> 01:13:27,762
my sister...

1191
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:28,995
and me.

1192
01:13:28,997 --> 01:13:30,329
And you?

1193
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,697
Where are you right now?

1194
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:03,694
You're welcome.

1195
01:14:03,696 --> 01:14:06,661
I didn't ask for your help.

1196
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:08,363
And yet, you always need it.

1197
01:14:12,196 --> 01:14:14,528
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1198
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,661
Why?

1199
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,663
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1200
01:14:22,061 --> 01:14:23,594
Where?

1201
01:14:23,596 --> 01:14:25,563
On a planet
called Morag.

1202
01:14:27,061 --> 01:14:29,126
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1203
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:31,461
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1204
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:32,761
It's a start.

1205
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:34,596
If he gets all of them...

1206
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:49,260
Ronan's located
the Power Stone.

1207
01:14:49,262 --> 01:14:51,159
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1208
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,660
He won't like that.

1209
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:54,762
His alternative is death.

1210
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:58,161
Ronan's obsession...

1211
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:01,328
clouds his judgment.

1212
01:15:05,662 --> 01:15:07,495
We will not fail you, Father.

1213
01:15:08,529 --> 01:15:10,228
No, you won't.

1214
01:15:12,794 --> 01:15:13,794
I swear...

1215
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:17,629
I will make you proud.

1216
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:29,593
<i>...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i>

1217
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:31,926
<i>and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?</i>

1218
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:34,392
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

1219
01:15:34,394 --> 01:15:36,292
<i>We're not the only ones
in 2014</i>

1220
01:15:36,294 --> 01:15:37,494
<i>looking for the stones.</i>

1221
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:41,325
Who was that?

1222
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:42,459
I don't know.

1223
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:44,794
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1224
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,327
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1225
01:15:49,861 --> 01:15:51,327
Shh.

1226
01:15:59,528 --> 01:16:01,561
Bring her to my ship.

1227
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:10,259
Better hustle, Cap.

1228
01:16:10,261 --> 01:16:11,992
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1229
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:14,160
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

1230
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:22,193
If it's all
the same to you...

1231
01:16:24,226 --> 01:16:26,291
I'll have
that drink now.

1232
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:27,992
All right,
get him on his feet.

1233
01:16:27,994 --> 01:16:31,124
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1234
01:16:31,126 --> 01:16:32,659
By the way, feel free
to clean up.

1235
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:35,858
Mr. Rogers,
I almost forgot that that suit...

1236
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,491
did nothing for your ass.

1237
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:39,057
<i>No one
asked you to look, Tony.</i>

1238
01:16:39,059 --> 01:16:40,191
It's ridiculous.

1239
01:16:40,193 --> 01:16:41,491
<i>I think
you look great, Cap.</i>

1240
01:16:41,493 --> 01:16:43,992
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

1241
01:16:43,994 --> 01:16:45,925
Who gets
the, uh, magic wand?

1242
01:16:45,927 --> 01:16:47,157
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1243
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:48,493
coming to secure it.

1244
01:16:58,226 --> 01:17:00,157
We can take that
off your hands.

1245
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,360
By all means.

1246
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,258
Careful with that thing.

1247
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,957
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1248
01:17:06,959 --> 01:17:08,056
And not in a fun way.

1249
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:09,258
We promise to be careful.

1250
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,558
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1251
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,724
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1252
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:15,123
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1253
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:17,391
<i>Seriously?
You didn't?</i>

1254
01:17:17,393 --> 01:17:19,123
<i>I mean, they look
like bad guys.</i>

1255
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,591
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1256
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:22,591
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1257
01:17:22,593 --> 01:17:24,690
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1258
01:17:24,692 --> 01:17:27,591
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1259
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:29,390
Shut up.

1260
01:17:29,392 --> 01:17:30,957
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1261
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:33,190
There's our stone.

1262
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:34,525
<i>All right.</i>

1263
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:35,659
<i>Flick me.</i>

1264
01:17:49,725 --> 01:17:50,857
- Move.
- Hey.

1265
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:52,590
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey. Buddy!

1266
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:54,689
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1267
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:55,891
Take the stairs.

1268
01:17:55,893 --> 01:17:57,624
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1269
01:18:00,392 --> 01:18:04,092
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1270
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:09,623
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1271
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:11,459
just passing the 80th floor.

1272
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:13,292
On it.

1273
01:18:13,758 --> 01:18:14,956
Head to the lobby.

1274
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:16,155
<i>All right,
I'll see you there.</i>

1275
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:17,956
Evidence secure.

1276
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,055
We're en route
to Doctor List.

1277
01:18:20,057 --> 01:18:23,157
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1278
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,155
Captain.

1279
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:30,524
I thought
you were coordinating

1280
01:18:30,526 --> 01:18:31,389
search and rescue.

1281
01:18:31,391 --> 01:18:33,224
Change of plans.

1282
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:38,424
Hey, Cap.

1283
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:40,691
Rumlow.

1284
01:18:46,925 --> 01:18:48,923
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1285
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:51,024
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1286
01:18:53,224 --> 01:18:55,624
Sir? I don't understand.

1287
01:18:57,992 --> 01:18:59,990
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1288
01:18:59,992 --> 01:19:01,788
Sorry, Cap.

1289
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,588
We can't give you
the scepter.

1290
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:05,822
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1291
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:08,124
That's okay. Trust me.

1292
01:19:11,525 --> 01:19:12,525
Hail Hydra.

1293
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,054
So many stairs!

1294
01:19:40,556 --> 01:19:43,587
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1295
01:19:43,589 --> 01:19:44,521
It is go time.

1296
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:45,790
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1297
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:55,421
<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

1298
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,921
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1299
01:19:57,923 --> 01:19:59,121
Can we focus, please?

1300
01:19:59,123 --> 01:20:00,523
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

1301
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,290
<i>now.</i>

1302
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,488
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1303
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:12,020
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1304
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:13,153
Alexander Pierce.

1305
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:14,654
He's the man
above the folks

1306
01:20:14,656 --> 01:20:15,854
- behind Nick Fury.
- Oh.

1307
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:17,087
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1308
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:18,153
I'm gonna have to ask you

1309
01:20:18,155 --> 01:20:19,455
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1310
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:21,421
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1311
01:20:21,423 --> 01:20:22,754
No, he's going
to answer to us.

1312
01:20:22,756 --> 01:20:24,120
Odin can have what's left.

1313
01:20:24,122 --> 01:20:25,621
And I'm gonna need
that case.

1314
01:20:25,623 --> 01:20:27,787
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1315
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:29,053
Hand over the case, Stark.

1316
01:20:29,055 --> 01:20:30,320
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1317
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:31,687
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1318
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:33,854
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1319
01:20:33,856 --> 01:20:35,220
<i>You promise me
you won't die?</i>

1320
01:20:35,222 --> 01:20:38,120
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1321
01:20:38,122 --> 01:20:39,921
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

1322
01:20:39,923 --> 01:20:41,087
I need the case.

1323
01:20:41,089 --> 01:20:42,420
I know you got a lot of
pull, I'm just saying,

1324
01:20:42,422 --> 01:20:43,954
- jurisdiction...
- Okay, then give me the case.

1325
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:45,020
Well, jurisdiction...

1326
01:20:45,022 --> 01:20:46,087
Hand it over.

1327
01:20:46,089 --> 01:20:47,153
Do it, Lang!

1328
01:20:47,155 --> 01:20:48,220
Get your hands off me.

1329
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:50,153
Window's closing.
Pull my pin.

1330
01:20:50,155 --> 01:20:51,620
<i>Here goes!</i>

1331
01:20:54,222 --> 01:20:56,055
- Stark?
- Stark?

1332
01:20:57,122 --> 01:20:58,520
He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1333
01:20:58,522 --> 01:21:00,720
- Medic!
- Medic!

1334
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,320
Give these guys
some help.

1335
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:03,887
Speak to me.

1336
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:05,722
Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1337
01:21:08,522 --> 01:21:09,788
Breathe, breathe.

1338
01:21:14,989 --> 01:21:16,253
Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1339
01:21:16,255 --> 01:21:17,455
I'm gonna grab
a quick slice.

1340
01:21:23,021 --> 01:21:25,086
No stairs!

1341
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:34,253
Uh... Come on, Stark,
stay with us.

1342
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:35,319
I'm going to
try something. Okay?

1343
01:21:35,321 --> 01:21:37,186
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1344
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:39,619
Yes!

1345
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:41,052
Oh, that worked a treat.

1346
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:42,186
Dude, that was so crazy.

1347
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:43,820
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1348
01:21:43,822 --> 01:21:45,853
- The case.
- The case is, uh...

1349
01:21:45,855 --> 01:21:48,054
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1350
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:50,186
Loki!

1351
01:21:50,188 --> 01:21:51,552
<i>That wasn't
supposed to happen, was it?</i>

1352
01:21:51,554 --> 01:21:52,685
Oh, we blew it.

1353
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:54,152
Loki?

1354
01:21:56,121 --> 01:21:57,554
Tony, what's going on?

1355
01:21:58,355 --> 01:22:00,288
Tell me you found that Cube.

1356
01:22:02,988 --> 01:22:04,521
Oh, you gotta be
shitting me.

1357
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,886
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1358
01:22:10,888 --> 01:22:12,387
I'm not Loki...

1359
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:17,554
and I don't wanna
hurt you.

1360
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:27,619
I can do this all day.

1361
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:28,986
Yeah, I know.

1362
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:30,187
I know.

1363
01:23:02,753 --> 01:23:03,753
Where did you get this?

1364
01:23:14,987 --> 01:23:18,219
Bucky is alive.

1365
01:23:21,653 --> 01:23:22,686
What?

1366
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:39,253
That is America's ass.

1367
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:44,483
Please, please.

1368
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:46,585
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1369
01:23:47,418 --> 01:23:48,951
If I give up
the Time Stone

1370
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:50,850
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1371
01:23:50,852 --> 01:23:52,583
With all due respect,
all right...

1372
01:23:52,585 --> 01:23:56,052
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1373
01:24:01,552 --> 01:24:03,383
The Infinity Stones create

1374
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:05,917
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1375
01:24:05,919 --> 01:24:07,683
Remove one of the stones...

1376
01:24:07,685 --> 01:24:09,884
and that flow splits.

1377
01:24:09,886 --> 01:24:12,383
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1378
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:14,984
but my new one,
not so much.

1379
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:16,884
In this new branch reality...

1380
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,683
without our chief weapon

1381
01:24:18,685 --> 01:24:20,282
against the forces
of darkness...

1382
01:24:20,284 --> 01:24:22,550
our world would be overrun.

1383
01:24:22,552 --> 01:24:24,449
Millions will suffer.

1384
01:24:24,451 --> 01:24:26,116
So, tell me, Doctor.

1385
01:24:26,118 --> 01:24:28,583
Can your science
prevent all that?

1386
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:29,585
No...

1387
01:24:30,585 --> 01:24:31,617
but we can erase it.

1388
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:33,516
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1389
01:24:33,518 --> 01:24:35,984
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1390
01:24:35,986 --> 01:24:37,717
at the moment it was taken.

1391
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:40,284
So, chronologically...

1392
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:42,351
in that reality...

1393
01:24:44,818 --> 01:24:46,551
it never left.

1394
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:52,118
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1395
01:24:55,384 --> 01:24:58,083
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1396
01:24:58,085 --> 01:25:01,415
We will. I will.
I promise.

1397
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:03,651
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1398
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:08,048
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1399
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,182
to protect the Time Stone.

1400
01:25:10,184 --> 01:25:12,283
Then why the hell
did Strange give it away?

1401
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:15,248
What did you say?

1402
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,718
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1403
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:20,084
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1404
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,616
- Why?
- I have no idea.

1405
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:27,416
Maybe he made a mistake.

1406
01:25:37,517 --> 01:25:38,751
Or I did.

1407
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:01,414
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1408
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:04,216
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1409
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,550
I fear you might be right.

1410
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:12,683
Thank you.

1411
01:26:18,884 --> 01:26:20,617
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1412
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,016
We all are.

1413
01:26:44,182 --> 01:26:46,016
Run diagnostics.

1414
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:48,582
Show me her memory file.

1415
01:26:50,049 --> 01:26:52,616
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1416
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:55,716
It was a memory,
but not hers.

1417
01:26:56,916 --> 01:26:58,580
There's another
consciousness...

1418
01:26:58,582 --> 01:27:00,015
sharing her network.

1419
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:01,716
Another Nebula.

1420
01:27:03,816 --> 01:27:05,313
Impossible.

1421
01:27:05,315 --> 01:27:08,947
This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1422
01:27:08,949 --> 01:27:11,281
from nine years
in the future.

1423
01:27:15,749 --> 01:27:18,881
Where is this other Nebula?

1424
01:27:18,883 --> 01:27:21,081
In our
solar system on Morag.

1425
01:27:22,516 --> 01:27:23,881
Can you access her?

1426
01:27:23,883 --> 01:27:26,046
Yes,
the two are linked.

1427
01:27:26,048 --> 01:27:28,246
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1428
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:30,615
for Infinity Stones.

1429
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:35,379
<i>And these stones have been</i>

1430
01:27:35,381 --> 01:27:37,145
<i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i>

1431
01:27:37,147 --> 01:27:38,279
<i>Our history.</i>

1432
01:27:38,281 --> 01:27:40,713
<i>So, not a lot
of convenient spots</i>

1433
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:41,847
<i>to just drop in.</i>

1434
01:27:41,849 --> 01:27:43,613
<i>Which means
we have to pick our targets.</i>

1435
01:27:43,615 --> 01:27:45,248
- <i>Correct.</i>
- Freeze image.

1436
01:27:47,015 --> 01:27:48,381
Terrans.

1437
01:27:49,448 --> 01:27:51,181
Avengers.

1438
01:27:52,047 --> 01:27:53,946
Unruly wretches.

1439
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:55,548
What's that reflection?

1440
01:27:57,046 --> 01:27:58,381
Amplify this, Maw.

1441
01:28:01,781 --> 01:28:03,146
I don't understand.

1442
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:09,312
Two Nebulas.

1443
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:12,046
No.
The same Nebula...

1444
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:14,481
from two different times.

1445
01:28:15,715 --> 01:28:17,378
Set course for Morag.

1446
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:20,046
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1447
01:28:20,648 --> 01:28:23,146
I wanna see everything.

1448
01:28:32,848 --> 01:28:34,880
My ladies,
I'll see you after.

1449
01:28:34,882 --> 01:28:36,413
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1450
01:28:50,714 --> 01:28:51,778
What are you doing?

1451
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,512
Oh, God!

1452
01:28:54,514 --> 01:28:57,178
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1453
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,211
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1454
01:28:59,213 --> 01:29:00,612
What are you wearing?

1455
01:29:00,614 --> 01:29:03,177
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1456
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,177
Mm...

1457
01:29:07,179 --> 01:29:08,812
What's wrong
with your eye?

1458
01:29:08,814 --> 01:29:09,945
Oh, my eye.

1459
01:29:09,947 --> 01:29:12,043
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

1460
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:13,310
when I got hit
in the face

1461
01:29:13,312 --> 01:29:15,312
with the broadsword?

1462
01:29:18,514 --> 01:29:20,747
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1463
01:29:21,547 --> 01:29:23,544
Yes, I am.

1464
01:29:23,546 --> 01:29:26,511
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1465
01:29:26,513 --> 01:29:29,010
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1466
01:29:29,012 --> 01:29:32,477
I was raised by witches, boy.

1467
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:35,179
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1468
01:29:37,045 --> 01:29:39,577
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1469
01:29:39,579 --> 01:29:41,210
Yes, you are, honey.

1470
01:29:41,212 --> 01:29:42,944
I really need
to talk to you.

1471
01:29:42,946 --> 01:29:44,145
We can talk.

1472
01:30:08,044 --> 01:30:10,711
His head was over there...

1473
01:30:10,713 --> 01:30:14,109
and his body over there...

1474
01:30:14,111 --> 01:30:17,677
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1475
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,378
I was just standing there.

1476
01:30:20,144 --> 01:30:22,076
Some idiot with an axe.

1477
01:30:22,078 --> 01:30:24,044
Now,
you're no idiot.

1478
01:30:24,945 --> 01:30:26,576
You're here, aren't you?

1479
01:30:26,578 --> 01:30:29,610
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1480
01:30:29,612 --> 01:30:30,777
I am. Yes.

1481
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:32,376
Idiot, no.

1482
01:30:32,378 --> 01:30:33,910
A failure?

1483
01:30:33,912 --> 01:30:35,142
Absolutely.

1484
01:30:35,144 --> 01:30:37,109
That's a little bit harsh.

1485
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:38,712
Do you know
what that makes you?

1486
01:30:39,879 --> 01:30:42,009
Just like everyone else.

1487
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:44,343
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1488
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:45,510
Mm.

1489
01:30:45,512 --> 01:30:49,209
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1490
01:30:49,211 --> 01:30:52,376
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1491
01:30:52,378 --> 01:30:56,077
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1492
01:31:01,077 --> 01:31:02,645
I've really
missed you, Mom.

1493
01:31:08,545 --> 01:31:10,344
Thor! I got it!

1494
01:31:11,043 --> 01:31:12,678
Get that rabbit!

1495
01:31:15,478 --> 01:31:17,475
Mom, I have to
tell you something.

1496
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:19,242
No, son, you don't.

1497
01:31:19,244 --> 01:31:21,976
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1498
01:31:21,978 --> 01:31:23,776
This is about your future.

1499
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,310
Uh, it's none of
my business.

1500
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:30,642
Hi.

1501
01:31:30,644 --> 01:31:32,575
You must be Mom.

1502
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:34,275
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1503
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:35,976
Oh, I wish
we had more time.

1504
01:31:35,978 --> 01:31:37,976
No, this was a gift.

1505
01:31:37,978 --> 01:31:41,875
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1506
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:43,008
I love you, Mom.

1507
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:44,210
I love you.

1508
01:31:48,577 --> 01:31:50,511
And eat a salad.

1509
01:31:51,511 --> 01:31:52,742
Come on, we gotta go.

1510
01:31:52,744 --> 01:31:54,542
- Goodbye.
- Three...

1511
01:31:54,544 --> 01:31:55,611
- Two...
- No, wait!

1512
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,107
What am I looking at?

1513
01:32:00,109 --> 01:32:01,677
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1514
01:32:11,076 --> 01:32:13,276
I'm still worthy.

1515
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:16,309
Oh, boy.

1516
01:32:17,243 --> 01:32:19,376
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1517
01:32:58,543 --> 01:33:00,243
So, he's an idiot?

1518
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:03,041
Yeah.

1519
01:33:11,443 --> 01:33:12,740
What's that?

1520
01:33:12,742 --> 01:33:14,643
The tool of a thief.

1521
01:33:22,308 --> 01:33:24,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1522
01:33:24,242 --> 01:33:26,073
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1523
01:33:26,075 --> 01:33:27,740
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1524
01:33:27,742 --> 01:33:29,039
What are you
talking about?

1525
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:30,139
When you break into
a place called

1526
01:33:30,141 --> 01:33:31,440
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1527
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:33,006
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1528
01:33:33,008 --> 01:33:35,408
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1529
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:10,207
I wasn't always like this.

1530
01:34:10,941 --> 01:34:12,140
Me either.

1531
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:15,341
But we work
with what we got, right?

1532
01:34:16,908 --> 01:34:18,174
Hmm.

1533
01:34:18,941 --> 01:34:20,674
Let's sync up.

1534
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:25,140
Three, two, one.

1535
01:34:37,807 --> 01:34:39,439
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

1536
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:40,938
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

1537
01:34:42,474 --> 01:34:44,472
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

1538
01:34:44,474 --> 01:34:45,474
<i>Gone.</i>

1539
01:34:46,074 --> 01:34:47,838
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

1540
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,606
<i>You used them
two days ago!</i>

1541
01:34:49,608 --> 01:34:52,938
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

1542
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:54,938
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

1543
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:57,004
<i>But the work is done.</i>

1544
01:34:57,006 --> 01:34:59,073
<i>It always will be.</i>

1545
01:35:00,106 --> 01:35:03,673
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

1546
01:35:04,874 --> 01:35:07,037
What did you do
to them?

1547
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:08,441
Nothing.

1548
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:10,574
Yet.

1549
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,204
They're not trying
to stop something

1550
01:35:14,206 --> 01:35:16,238
I'm going to do
in our time.

1551
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,304
They're trying
to undo something

1552
01:35:18,306 --> 01:35:20,071
I've already done
in theirs.

1553
01:35:20,073 --> 01:35:22,006
The stones.

1554
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,672
I found them all.

1555
01:35:26,507 --> 01:35:28,404
I won.

1556
01:35:28,406 --> 01:35:31,572
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1557
01:35:35,572 --> 01:35:37,637
This is your future.

1558
01:35:37,639 --> 01:35:39,672
It's my destiny.

1559
01:35:40,839 --> 01:35:43,004
<i>My father is many things.</i>

1560
01:35:43,006 --> 01:35:45,073
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

1561
01:35:46,606 --> 01:35:47,606
<i>Ah.</i>

1562
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,704
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

1563
01:35:50,706 --> 01:35:53,103
<i>Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.</i>

1564
01:35:57,239 --> 01:36:00,340
And that is
destiny fulfilled.

1565
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,103
Sire...

1566
01:36:02,105 --> 01:36:03,704
your daughter...

1567
01:36:05,772 --> 01:36:07,136
No!

1568
01:36:07,138 --> 01:36:08,303
...is a traitor.

1569
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:11,003
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1570
01:36:11,005 --> 01:36:12,470
I would never betray you.

1571
01:36:12,472 --> 01:36:14,339
Never. Never.

1572
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:22,036
I know.

1573
01:36:22,038 --> 01:36:25,439
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1574
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:32,738
No!

1575
01:36:33,506 --> 01:36:34,671
He knows!

1576
01:36:39,138 --> 01:36:41,372
Barton! Barton, come in.

1577
01:36:41,872 --> 01:36:43,803
Romanoff!

1578
01:36:43,805 --> 01:36:45,470
Come in, we have a problem.

1579
01:36:45,472 --> 01:36:46,703
Come on!

1580
01:36:46,705 --> 01:36:48,370
Come in, we have a...

1581
01:36:48,372 --> 01:36:49,638
Thanos knows.

1582
01:36:50,372 --> 01:36:51,571
Thanos...

1583
01:37:05,338 --> 01:37:06,404
Cap.

1584
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:10,202
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1585
01:37:10,204 --> 01:37:12,903
Yeah, we do.

1586
01:37:12,905 --> 01:37:14,102
Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1587
01:37:14,104 --> 01:37:15,169
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1588
01:37:15,171 --> 01:37:16,535
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1589
01:37:16,537 --> 01:37:18,502
You said
that we had one shot.

1590
01:37:18,504 --> 01:37:19,703
This was our shot.

1591
01:37:19,705 --> 01:37:21,836
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1592
01:37:21,838 --> 01:37:23,468
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself,

1593
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,803
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1594
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,602
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1595
01:37:26,604 --> 01:37:27,468
Dude. Come on!

1596
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:28,602
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1597
01:37:28,604 --> 01:37:30,102
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1598
01:37:30,104 --> 01:37:31,169
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1599
01:37:31,171 --> 01:37:32,402
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

1600
01:37:32,404 --> 01:37:34,369
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1601
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:35,869
No, no, no, there's
no other options.

1602
01:37:35,871 --> 01:37:37,269
There's no do-overs.

1603
01:37:37,271 --> 01:37:39,502
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1604
01:37:39,504 --> 01:37:40,402
Each.

1605
01:37:40,404 --> 01:37:42,969
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1606
01:37:42,971 --> 01:37:44,269
bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1607
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:46,336
Yeah, well,
if we don't try...

1608
01:37:46,338 --> 01:37:47,802
then no one else
is going home, either.

1609
01:37:47,804 --> 01:37:49,003
I got it.

1610
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:52,236
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1611
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:54,869
and acquire new particles.

1612
01:37:54,871 --> 01:37:56,535
Little stroll down
memory lane.

1613
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:58,604
Military installation,
Garden State.

1614
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:03,835
When were they both there?

1615
01:38:03,837 --> 01:38:07,068
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1616
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,134
- How vague?
- What are you talking about?

1617
01:38:08,136 --> 01:38:09,268
Where are we going?

1618
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:10,301
I know for a fact
they were there.

1619
01:38:10,303 --> 01:38:11,568
Who's they?
What are we doing?

1620
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:12,637
And I know how I know.

1621
01:38:14,569 --> 01:38:16,668
Guys, what is it?

1622
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:18,335
Looks like
we're improvising.

1623
01:38:18,337 --> 01:38:19,735
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1624
01:38:19,737 --> 01:38:21,667
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1625
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:22,869
Suit up.

1626
01:38:22,871 --> 01:38:24,467
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

1627
01:38:24,469 --> 01:38:25,567
0-4.

1628
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:26,701
- Uh, 0-7.
- 0-7.

1629
01:38:26,703 --> 01:38:28,969
- Excuse me.
- 1-9-7-0.

1630
01:38:28,971 --> 01:38:30,034
Are you sure?

1631
01:38:30,036 --> 01:38:31,601
Cap? Captain?

1632
01:38:31,603 --> 01:38:33,601
Steve? Sorry.

1633
01:38:33,603 --> 01:38:35,235
America. Rogers.

1634
01:38:35,237 --> 01:38:36,634
Look, if you do this...

1635
01:38:36,636 --> 01:38:39,469
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1636
01:38:40,337 --> 01:38:42,370
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1637
01:38:43,402 --> 01:38:44,569
You trust me?

1638
01:38:45,469 --> 01:38:46,603
I do.

1639
01:38:47,636 --> 01:38:49,102
Your call.

1640
01:38:49,803 --> 01:38:51,569
Here we go.

1641
01:39:07,401 --> 01:39:11,302
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1642
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:19,901
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1643
01:39:19,903 --> 01:39:22,433
The idea of me was.

1644
01:39:22,435 --> 01:39:24,234
Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1645
01:39:24,236 --> 01:39:27,602
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1646
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:30,666
where do you hide it?

1647
01:39:30,668 --> 01:39:32,401
In plain sight.

1648
01:40:00,502 --> 01:40:01,933
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1649
01:40:01,935 --> 01:40:04,568
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1650
01:40:07,902 --> 01:40:09,168
You new here?

1651
01:40:11,602 --> 01:40:13,068
Not exactly.

1652
01:40:19,634 --> 01:40:21,467
Come on, you bastard.

1653
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:29,701
Gotcha.

1654
01:40:34,601 --> 01:40:35,601
Whew.

1655
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:49,033
Back in the game.

1656
01:40:51,567 --> 01:40:52,734
Arnim, you in there?

1657
01:40:53,701 --> 01:40:54,734
Arnim?

1658
01:40:59,968 --> 01:41:01,966
Hey!

1659
01:41:01,968 --> 01:41:03,734
The door is this way, pal.

1660
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:05,599
Oh, yeah.

1661
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:07,599
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1662
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:11,333
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1663
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:14,200
Pardon me.

1664
01:41:14,801 --> 01:41:16,500
Do I know you?

1665
01:41:17,701 --> 01:41:18,700
No, sir. Uh...

1666
01:41:20,067 --> 01:41:22,100
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1667
01:41:22,566 --> 01:41:23,666
Oh. MIT.

1668
01:41:24,033 --> 01:41:25,333
Got a name?

1669
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:26,932
Howard.

1670
01:41:26,934 --> 01:41:29,533
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

1671
01:41:30,533 --> 01:41:31,998
Potts.

1672
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,498
Well,
I'm Howard Stark.

1673
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,364
Hi.

1674
01:41:35,366 --> 01:41:36,931
Shake that,
don't pull it.

1675
01:41:36,933 --> 01:41:38,133
Yeah.

1676
01:41:39,266 --> 01:41:41,764
You look a little green around the
gills, there, Potts.

1677
01:41:41,766 --> 01:41:44,030
I'm fine.
Just long hours.

1678
01:41:44,032 --> 01:41:45,999
You wanna get some air?

1679
01:41:48,233 --> 01:41:50,196
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

1680
01:41:50,198 --> 01:41:51,731
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

1681
01:41:51,733 --> 01:41:52,831
Okay.

1682
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:54,566
Need your briefcase?

1683
01:41:58,633 --> 01:42:01,500
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1684
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:08,931
- Hello?
- <i>Doctor Pym?</i>

1685
01:42:08,933 --> 01:42:11,463
That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1686
01:42:11,465 --> 01:42:13,965
<i>This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.</i>

1687
01:42:13,967 --> 01:42:15,130
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

1688
01:42:15,132 --> 01:42:16,831
Oh, bring it up.

1689
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:18,999
<i>That's the thing, sir,
we can't.</i>

1690
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,730
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1691
01:42:22,732 --> 01:42:24,163
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

1692
01:42:24,165 --> 01:42:25,865
<i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i>

1693
01:42:25,867 --> 01:42:27,196
<i>and to be honest,</i>

1694
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:28,830
<i>some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i>

1695
01:42:28,832 --> 01:42:30,530
They didn't open it,
did they?

1696
01:42:30,532 --> 01:42:33,066
<i>Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

1697
01:42:33,732 --> 01:42:35,665
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1698
01:43:02,599 --> 01:43:06,397
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1699
01:43:06,998 --> 01:43:08,697
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1700
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:11,564
And too much time
at the office.

1701
01:43:13,431 --> 01:43:14,662
Congratulations.

1702
01:43:14,664 --> 01:43:18,063
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

1703
01:43:18,065 --> 01:43:20,297
- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.

1704
01:43:21,932 --> 01:43:23,096
She's at the point where

1705
01:43:23,098 --> 01:43:24,662
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1706
01:43:24,664 --> 01:43:28,431
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1707
01:43:29,164 --> 01:43:30,496
I have a little girl.

1708
01:43:30,498 --> 01:43:32,029
A girl would be nice.

1709
01:43:32,031 --> 01:43:34,762
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1710
01:43:34,764 --> 01:43:36,262
What'd be so awful
about that?

1711
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:38,329
Let's just say
that the greater good

1712
01:43:38,331 --> 01:43:41,764
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1713
01:43:45,598 --> 01:43:47,262
And you've never seen
these two men before?

1714
01:43:47,264 --> 01:43:48,963
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1715
01:43:48,965 --> 01:43:50,028
Can you describe them?

1716
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:51,329
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1717
01:43:51,331 --> 01:43:53,562
Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1718
01:43:53,564 --> 01:43:54,929
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1719
01:43:54,931 --> 01:43:56,028
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1720
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:57,194
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1721
01:43:57,196 --> 01:43:59,296
We have
a potential breach.

1722
01:44:16,997 --> 01:44:18,161
I said bring them in.

1723
01:44:18,163 --> 01:44:19,261
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1724
01:44:19,263 --> 01:44:20,461
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1725
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:21,361
Oh, for the love of...

1726
01:44:21,363 --> 01:44:23,163
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1727
01:44:46,964 --> 01:44:49,162
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1728
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:02,126
So, where you at
with names?

1729
01:45:02,128 --> 01:45:05,360
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1730
01:45:05,362 --> 01:45:07,595
Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1731
01:45:07,597 --> 01:45:09,162
- You got time.
- Uh-huh.

1732
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:12,862
Let me ask you
a question.

1733
01:45:12,864 --> 01:45:16,193
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1734
01:45:16,195 --> 01:45:17,862
Wildly.

1735
01:45:17,864 --> 01:45:19,760
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

1736
01:45:19,762 --> 01:45:21,527
Like you had any idea

1737
01:45:21,529 --> 01:45:23,560
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1738
01:45:23,562 --> 01:45:26,760
I literally pieced it
together as I went along.

1739
01:45:26,762 --> 01:45:29,126
I thought about
what my dad did.

1740
01:45:29,128 --> 01:45:30,427
My old man,

1741
01:45:30,429 --> 01:45:32,293
he never met a problem he
couldn't solve with a belt.

1742
01:45:32,295 --> 01:45:34,660
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1743
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:35,992
And now,
looking back on it,

1744
01:45:35,994 --> 01:45:37,360
I just remember
the good stuff.

1745
01:45:37,362 --> 01:45:39,160
You know? He did drop
the odd pearl.

1746
01:45:39,162 --> 01:45:41,560
Yeah? Like what?

1747
01:45:41,562 --> 01:45:44,362
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1748
01:45:45,629 --> 01:45:46,992
Smart guy.

1749
01:45:46,994 --> 01:45:48,562
He did his best.

1750
01:45:49,863 --> 01:45:51,326
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1751
01:45:51,328 --> 01:45:54,027
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1752
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:04,127
Good to meet you, Potts.

1753
01:46:04,528 --> 01:46:05,528
Yeah.

1754
01:46:05,863 --> 01:46:07,459
Howard...

1755
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:09,328
everything's gonna be
all right.

1756
01:46:12,328 --> 01:46:13,528
Thank you...

1757
01:46:14,495 --> 01:46:16,092
for everything...

1758
01:46:16,094 --> 01:46:18,528
you've done
for this country.

1759
01:46:21,428 --> 01:46:22,528
Jarvis.

1760
01:46:26,094 --> 01:46:27,728
Have we ever met
that guy?

1761
01:46:29,728 --> 01:46:31,328
You meet
a lot of people, sir.

1762
01:46:33,828 --> 01:46:35,528
Seems very familiar.

1763
01:46:36,461 --> 01:46:38,026
Weird beard.

1764
01:46:45,795 --> 01:46:47,294
You're weak.

1765
01:46:47,728 --> 01:46:48,993
I'm you.

1766
01:47:06,293 --> 01:47:08,793
You could stop this.

1767
01:47:08,795 --> 01:47:11,191
You know you want to.

1768
01:47:11,193 --> 01:47:13,527
Did you see what happens
in the future?

1769
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,260
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1770
01:47:18,494 --> 01:47:20,694
You wanna know
how he does that?

1771
01:47:21,993 --> 01:47:26,327
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1772
01:47:26,727 --> 01:47:28,124
That's enough.

1773
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,125
You disgust me.

1774
01:47:43,159 --> 01:47:48,259
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1775
01:48:09,794 --> 01:48:11,559
How do I look?

1776
01:48:18,226 --> 01:48:19,226
Wow.

1777
01:48:20,025 --> 01:48:23,257
Under different
circumstances...

1778
01:48:23,259 --> 01:48:25,459
this would be
totally awesome.

1779
01:48:37,192 --> 01:48:38,757
I bet the raccoon

1780
01:48:38,759 --> 01:48:40,357
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1781
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:42,357
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1782
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:44,189
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1783
01:48:44,191 --> 01:48:45,659
Welcome.

1784
01:48:48,792 --> 01:48:50,189
Natasha.

1785
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:51,392
Daughter of Ivan.

1786
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:53,890
Clint.

1787
01:48:53,892 --> 01:48:56,325
Son of Edith.

1788
01:49:01,626 --> 01:49:03,691
Who are you?

1789
01:49:03,693 --> 01:49:06,389
Consider me a guide...

1790
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:08,056
to you...

1791
01:49:08,058 --> 01:49:10,056
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1792
01:49:10,058 --> 01:49:11,356
Oh, good.

1793
01:49:11,358 --> 01:49:13,525
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1794
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:19,658
If only it were that easy.

1795
01:49:31,525 --> 01:49:35,492
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1796
01:49:36,692 --> 01:49:39,225
As does what you fear.

1797
01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:46,556
The stone's down there.

1798
01:49:46,558 --> 01:49:48,722
For one of you.

1799
01:49:48,724 --> 01:49:50,492
For the other...

1800
01:49:53,023 --> 01:49:55,088
In order to take
the stone...

1801
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:58,290
you must lose
that which you love.

1802
01:49:59,592 --> 01:50:02,724
An everlasting exchange.

1803
01:50:03,724 --> 01:50:07,990
A soul for a soul.

1804
01:50:10,257 --> 01:50:13,123
How's it going?

1805
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:16,889
Jesus.

1806
01:50:16,891 --> 01:50:18,657
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1807
01:50:19,557 --> 01:50:21,023
No.

1808
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:23,255
I don't think so.

1809
01:50:23,257 --> 01:50:25,591
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1810
01:50:26,989 --> 01:50:28,224
I didn't.

1811
01:50:29,424 --> 01:50:32,123
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1812
01:50:32,657 --> 01:50:34,222
without his daughter.

1813
01:50:34,224 --> 01:50:36,491
That's not a coincidence.

1814
01:50:37,557 --> 01:50:39,257
Yeah.

1815
01:50:40,823 --> 01:50:42,723
Whatever it takes.

1816
01:50:47,122 --> 01:50:48,723
Whatever it takes.

1817
01:50:53,022 --> 01:50:55,120
If we don't get that stone...

1818
01:50:55,122 --> 01:50:57,056
billions of people stay dead.

1819
01:50:57,756 --> 01:50:59,089
Yeah.

1820
01:51:00,591 --> 01:51:03,089
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1821
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:05,022
I guess we do.

1822
01:51:13,156 --> 01:51:14,955
I'm starting to think

1823
01:51:14,957 --> 01:51:18,321
we mean different
people here, Natasha.

1824
01:51:18,323 --> 01:51:20,521
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1825
01:51:20,523 --> 01:51:21,653
Get to right here.

1826
01:51:21,655 --> 01:51:23,987
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1827
01:51:23,989 --> 01:51:26,287
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1828
01:51:26,289 --> 01:51:28,954
What, you think
I wanna do it?

1829
01:51:28,956 --> 01:51:30,887
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1830
01:51:30,889 --> 01:51:34,086
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1831
01:51:34,088 --> 01:51:36,456
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1832
01:51:37,988 --> 01:51:40,021
You know what I've become.

1833
01:51:41,922 --> 01:51:43,086
Oh, I don't judge people

1834
01:51:43,088 --> 01:51:44,590
on their worst mistakes.

1835
01:51:48,722 --> 01:51:50,121
Maybe you should.

1836
01:51:50,822 --> 01:51:52,455
You didn't.

1837
01:51:58,388 --> 01:52:00,755
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1838
01:52:11,822 --> 01:52:13,188
Okay.

1839
01:52:14,788 --> 01:52:16,388
You win.

1840
01:52:22,754 --> 01:52:24,088
Tell my family I love 'em.

1841
01:52:27,654 --> 01:52:29,018
You tell 'em yourself.

1842
01:53:01,688 --> 01:53:02,688
Damn you.

1843
01:53:10,287 --> 01:53:11,287
Wait.

1844
01:53:19,321 --> 01:53:21,187
Let me go.

1845
01:53:22,387 --> 01:53:23,387
No.

1846
01:53:24,986 --> 01:53:26,187
No. Please, no.

1847
01:53:29,488 --> 01:53:31,354
It's okay.

1848
01:53:33,387 --> 01:53:34,387
Please.

1849
01:53:36,454 --> 01:53:37,454
No!

1850
01:55:18,751 --> 01:55:19,751
Did we get 'em all?

1851
01:55:21,085 --> 01:55:23,118
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1852
01:55:27,785 --> 01:55:29,152
Clint, where's Nat?

1853
01:55:58,117 --> 01:55:59,318
Do we know
if she had family?

1854
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:01,716
Yeah.

1855
01:56:01,718 --> 01:56:02,718
Us.

1856
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:05,284
What?

1857
01:56:06,184 --> 01:56:07,249
Huh?

1858
01:56:07,251 --> 01:56:08,381
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

1859
01:56:08,383 --> 01:56:09,850
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1860
01:56:09,852 --> 01:56:11,015
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1861
01:56:11,017 --> 01:56:12,348
We have the stones, right?

1862
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:13,582
As long as we have
the stones...

1863
01:56:13,584 --> 01:56:15,415
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1864
01:56:15,417 --> 01:56:17,748
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1865
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:19,117
Can't get her back.

1866
01:56:21,917 --> 01:56:23,448
What's he...?
What?

1867
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:24,617
It can't be undone.

1868
01:56:25,284 --> 01:56:27,050
It can't.

1869
01:56:29,251 --> 01:56:30,815
Look, I'm sorry,
no offense,

1870
01:56:30,817 --> 01:56:32,482
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1871
01:56:32,484 --> 01:56:34,048
And we're talking
about space magic.

1872
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:36,181
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1873
01:56:36,183 --> 01:56:37,748
Yeah, look, I know
that I'm way outside

1874
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:39,215
my pay grade here.

1875
01:56:39,217 --> 01:56:40,882
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1876
01:56:40,884 --> 01:56:42,014
No, that's my point.

1877
01:56:42,016 --> 01:56:45,114
It can't be undone.

1878
01:56:45,116 --> 01:56:46,515
Or that's at least

1879
01:56:46,517 --> 01:56:48,515
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1880
01:56:48,517 --> 01:56:50,215
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1881
01:56:50,217 --> 01:56:53,449
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1882
01:57:01,884 --> 01:57:04,116
It was supposed to be me.

1883
01:57:06,116 --> 01:57:08,681
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1884
01:57:08,683 --> 01:57:10,250
She bet her life on it.

1885
01:57:14,983 --> 01:57:17,449
She's not coming back.

1886
01:57:19,083 --> 01:57:20,649
We have to make it
worth it.

1887
01:57:21,316 --> 01:57:22,683
We have to.

1888
01:57:24,015 --> 01:57:25,749
We will.

1889
01:57:50,482 --> 01:57:51,583
Boom!

1890
01:57:57,115 --> 01:57:59,313
All right,
the glove's ready.

1891
01:57:59,315 --> 01:58:02,113
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1892
01:58:02,115 --> 01:58:04,480
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

1893
01:58:04,482 --> 01:58:05,379
It's okay.

1894
01:58:05,381 --> 01:58:06,646
Stop, stop.
Slow down.

1895
01:58:06,648 --> 01:58:08,180
Thor. Just wait.

1896
01:58:08,182 --> 01:58:10,346
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1897
01:58:10,348 --> 01:58:12,080
I'm sorry. What, we're all
just sitting around

1898
01:58:12,082 --> 01:58:13,413
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1899
01:58:13,415 --> 01:58:14,847
We should at least
discuss it.

1900
01:58:14,849 --> 01:58:16,880
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1901
01:58:16,882 --> 01:58:18,715
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1902
01:58:19,748 --> 01:58:21,213
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

1903
01:58:21,215 --> 01:58:22,813
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1904
01:58:22,815 --> 01:58:24,112
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

1905
01:58:24,114 --> 01:58:26,079
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

1906
01:58:26,081 --> 01:58:28,114
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

1907
01:58:30,915 --> 01:58:32,446
Just let me do it.

1908
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:35,179
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1909
01:58:35,181 --> 01:58:36,379
Look, it's not
just the fact...

1910
01:58:36,381 --> 01:58:37,680
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1911
01:58:37,682 --> 01:58:38,613
to light up a continent.

1912
01:58:38,615 --> 01:58:40,680
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1913
01:58:40,682 --> 01:58:44,046
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1914
01:58:44,048 --> 01:58:45,280
Cheez Whiz?

1915
01:58:47,715 --> 01:58:48,847
Lightning.

1916
01:58:48,849 --> 01:58:50,079
Yeah.
Lightning.

1917
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,713
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1918
01:58:51,715 --> 01:58:53,581
It's gotta be me.

1919
01:58:54,849 --> 01:58:57,112
You saw what those
stones did to Thanos.

1920
01:58:57,114 --> 01:58:58,748
They almost killed him.

1921
01:59:00,081 --> 01:59:02,745
None of you could survive.

1922
01:59:02,747 --> 01:59:04,579
How do we know
you will?

1923
01:59:04,581 --> 01:59:05,847
We don't.

1924
01:59:05,849 --> 01:59:08,481
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1925
01:59:11,881 --> 01:59:13,547
It's like...

1926
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:17,380
I was made for this.

1927
01:59:36,113 --> 01:59:37,714
Good to go, yeah?

1928
01:59:39,814 --> 01:59:40,946
Let's do it.

1929
01:59:40,948 --> 01:59:42,311
Okay, remember,

1930
01:59:42,313 --> 01:59:44,111
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1931
01:59:44,113 --> 01:59:46,612
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1932
01:59:46,614 --> 01:59:48,346
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1933
01:59:49,681 --> 01:59:51,013
Got it.

1934
02:00:07,112 --> 02:00:08,411
<i>Friday, do me a favor</i>

1935
02:00:08,413 --> 02:00:10,078
<i>and activate Barn Door
Protocol, will ya?</i>

1936
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,513
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

1937
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:22,046
Everybody comes home.

1938
02:00:45,145 --> 02:00:46,811
Take it off! Take it off!

1939
02:00:46,813 --> 02:00:48,243
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1940
02:00:48,245 --> 02:00:50,412
<i>Talk to me, Banner.</i>

1941
02:00:53,545 --> 02:00:54,545
I'm okay.

1942
02:00:54,947 --> 02:00:56,378
I'm okay.

1943
02:01:27,712 --> 02:01:29,011
Bruce!

1944
02:01:30,612 --> 02:01:32,277
Don't move him.

1945
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:41,177
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

1946
02:02:27,544 --> 02:02:28,576
Honey.

1947
02:02:28,578 --> 02:02:29,676
<i>Clint?</i>

1948
02:02:29,678 --> 02:02:31,076
Honey.

1949
02:02:31,744 --> 02:02:33,210
Guys...

1950
02:02:35,578 --> 02:02:37,076
I think it worked.

1951
02:03:19,376 --> 02:03:21,308
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1952
02:03:22,643 --> 02:03:24,477
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1953
02:03:30,975 --> 02:03:33,008
Rhodey, Rocket,
get out of here.

1954
02:03:33,943 --> 02:03:35,577
Let me up! Let me up!

1955
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:37,175
Come on!

1956
02:03:47,275 --> 02:03:48,142
Rhodey!

1957
02:03:49,777 --> 02:03:51,075
Huh?

1958
02:03:56,375 --> 02:03:58,207
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

1959
02:03:58,209 --> 02:03:59,740
<i>We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

1960
02:03:59,742 --> 02:04:01,440
What? What?

1961
02:04:01,442 --> 02:04:03,907
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

1962
02:04:03,909 --> 02:04:06,173
Wait! I'm here!

1963
02:04:06,175 --> 02:04:07,975
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1964
02:04:27,476 --> 02:04:28,642
Cap?

1965
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,708
Okay.

1966
02:05:12,907 --> 02:05:14,339
Daughter.

1967
02:05:14,341 --> 02:05:15,475
Yes, Father.

1968
02:05:17,174 --> 02:05:19,140
So, this is the future.

1969
02:05:19,675 --> 02:05:20,541
Well done.

1970
02:05:21,475 --> 02:05:23,004
Thank you, Father.

1971
02:05:23,006 --> 02:05:24,508
They suspected nothing.

1972
02:05:26,775 --> 02:05:28,341
The arrogant never do.

1973
02:05:31,307 --> 02:05:33,205
Go.

1974
02:05:33,207 --> 02:05:35,839
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

1975
02:05:35,841 --> 02:05:37,608
What will you do?

1976
02:05:38,874 --> 02:05:40,608
Wait.

1977
02:06:05,773 --> 02:06:07,507
Tell me something.

1978
02:06:08,607 --> 02:06:11,071
In the future...

1979
02:06:11,073 --> 02:06:13,173
what happens
to you and me?

1980
02:06:15,407 --> 02:06:17,105
I try to kill you.

1981
02:06:18,674 --> 02:06:20,273
Several times.

1982
02:06:21,139 --> 02:06:23,438
But eventually...

1983
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,407
we become friends.

1984
02:06:26,806 --> 02:06:28,574
We become sisters.

1985
02:06:36,105 --> 02:06:37,473
Come on.

1986
02:06:39,506 --> 02:06:41,339
We can stop him.

1987
02:06:49,206 --> 02:06:50,737
Come on, buddy,
wake up!

1988
02:06:50,739 --> 02:06:53,404
That's my man.

1989
02:06:53,406 --> 02:06:55,639
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1990
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:00,337
What happened?

1991
02:07:00,339 --> 02:07:02,770
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1992
02:07:02,772 --> 02:07:03,673
You'll see.

1993
02:07:25,738 --> 02:07:27,238
What's he been doing?

1994
02:07:28,971 --> 02:07:30,506
Absolutely nothing.

1995
02:07:32,104 --> 02:07:34,303
Where are the stones?

1996
02:07:34,305 --> 02:07:36,371
Somewhere under all this.

1997
02:07:37,672 --> 02:07:39,969
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

1998
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:41,903
So, we keep it that way.

1999
02:07:41,905 --> 02:07:43,536
You know
it's a trap, right?

2000
02:07:43,538 --> 02:07:44,937
Yeah.

2001
02:07:44,939 --> 02:07:46,405
I don't much care.

2002
02:07:47,205 --> 02:07:48,969
Good.

2003
02:07:48,971 --> 02:07:51,635
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

2004
02:08:01,171 --> 02:08:03,371
Let's kill him
properly this time.

2005
02:08:12,472 --> 02:08:15,605
You could not live
with your own failure.

2006
02:08:17,003 --> 02:08:19,070
Where did that bring you?

2007
02:08:21,838 --> 02:08:23,737
Back to me.

2008
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:30,735
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2009
02:08:30,737 --> 02:08:33,168
the other half
would thrive.

2010
02:08:33,170 --> 02:08:34,637
But you've shown me...

2011
02:08:35,771 --> 02:08:37,572
that's impossible.

2012
02:08:39,304 --> 02:08:42,869
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2013
02:08:42,871 --> 02:08:44,335
there will always be those

2014
02:08:44,337 --> 02:08:48,237
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2015
02:08:48,838 --> 02:08:50,435
They will resist.

2016
02:08:50,437 --> 02:08:52,570
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2017
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:55,170
I'm thankful.

2018
02:08:57,103 --> 02:08:59,035
Because now...

2019
02:08:59,037 --> 02:09:01,701
I know what I must do.

2020
02:09:01,703 --> 02:09:04,801
I will shred
this universe...

2021
02:09:04,803 --> 02:09:07,037
down to its last atom.

2022
02:09:07,670 --> 02:09:09,335
And then...

2023
02:09:09,337 --> 02:09:12,002
with the stones
you've collected for me...

2024
02:09:12,636 --> 02:09:14,868
create a new one...

2025
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:17,167
teeming with life...

2026
02:09:17,169 --> 02:09:19,201
that knows not
what it has lost...

2027
02:09:19,203 --> 02:09:21,703
but only
what it has been given.

2028
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:26,303
A grateful universe.

2029
02:09:26,736 --> 02:09:28,201
Born out of blood.

2030
02:09:28,203 --> 02:09:30,136
They'll never know it.

2031
02:09:31,102 --> 02:09:34,236
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2032
02:09:48,702 --> 02:09:50,000
See you
on the other side, man.

2033
02:09:52,203 --> 02:09:54,403
Hang on!
I'm coming!

2034
02:10:24,602 --> 02:10:25,602
Yeah!

2035
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:42,066
Oh, hey.

2036
02:10:42,068 --> 02:10:44,035
I know you.

2037
02:10:46,769 --> 02:10:47,968
Father...

2038
02:10:48,568 --> 02:10:50,233
I have the stones.

2039
02:10:50,235 --> 02:10:51,168
What?

2040
02:10:52,468 --> 02:10:53,402
Stop.

2041
02:10:58,568 --> 02:11:00,101
You're betraying us?

2042
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:07,335
You don't have to do this.

2043
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,732
I am this.

2044
02:11:12,734 --> 02:11:15,032
No, you're not.

2045
02:11:15,034 --> 02:11:17,134
You've seen what we become.

2046
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,367
Nebula, listen to her.

2047
02:11:26,734 --> 02:11:27,634
You can change.

2048
02:11:34,367 --> 02:11:35,967
He won't let me.

2049
02:11:37,467 --> 02:11:38,267
No!

2050
02:11:57,767 --> 02:11:59,267
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2051
02:12:15,767 --> 02:12:17,200
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

2052
02:13:08,399 --> 02:13:09,632
I knew it!

2053
02:14:31,865 --> 02:14:34,731
In all my years
of conquest...

2054
02:14:35,964 --> 02:14:37,964
violence...

2055
02:14:38,798 --> 02:14:40,964
slaughter...

2056
02:14:41,865 --> 02:14:44,397
it was never personal.

2057
02:14:46,865 --> 02:14:49,131
But I'll tell you now...

2058
02:14:50,932 --> 02:14:54,829
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2059
02:14:54,831 --> 02:14:57,330
annoying little planet...

2060
02:14:58,931 --> 02:15:01,297
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2061
02:15:02,030 --> 02:15:04,697
very, very much.

2062
02:16:07,863 --> 02:16:09,496
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

2063
02:16:15,295 --> 02:16:17,729
<i>Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?</i>

2064
02:16:21,729 --> 02:16:23,261
<i>On your left.</i>

2065
02:17:48,727 --> 02:17:50,091
Is that everyone?

2066
02:17:50,093 --> 02:17:52,461
What? You wanted more?

2067
02:18:18,861 --> 02:18:21,026
Avengers...

2068
02:18:25,928 --> 02:18:27,057
assemble.

2069
02:19:02,326 --> 02:19:03,526
Die!

2070
02:19:24,025 --> 02:19:27,025
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2071
02:19:40,559 --> 02:19:41,425
Hey!

2072
02:19:42,425 --> 02:19:43,356
Holy cow!

2073
02:19:43,358 --> 02:19:44,924
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2074
02:19:44,926 --> 02:19:46,423
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2075
02:19:46,425 --> 02:19:47,857
And I got all dusty?

2076
02:19:47,859 --> 02:19:48,989
And I must've passed out,

2077
02:19:48,991 --> 02:19:50,523
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2078
02:19:50,525 --> 02:19:52,356
But Doctor Strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2079
02:19:52,358 --> 02:19:54,089
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2080
02:19:54,091 --> 02:19:55,623
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2081
02:19:55,625 --> 02:19:56,955
- that he does all the time.
- He did? Oh, no.

2082
02:19:56,957 --> 02:19:59,425
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

2083
02:20:03,425 --> 02:20:05,024
Oh, this is nice.

2084
02:20:26,625 --> 02:20:27,625
Gamora?

2085
02:20:36,957 --> 02:20:38,691
I thought I lost you.

2086
02:20:42,224 --> 02:20:43,155
Ow.

2087
02:20:43,157 --> 02:20:46,291
Don't touch me!

2088
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:51,088
You missed the first time.

2089
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:53,291
Then you got 'em both
the second time.

2090
02:20:55,090 --> 02:20:56,489
This is the one?

2091
02:20:56,491 --> 02:20:57,622
Seriously?

2092
02:20:57,624 --> 02:20:59,855
Your choices were him
or a tree.

2093
02:21:10,458 --> 02:21:11,522
Cap!

2094
02:21:11,524 --> 02:21:13,391
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2095
02:21:15,956 --> 02:21:18,121
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2096
02:21:18,123 --> 02:21:19,356
No!

2097
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:22,589
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2098
02:21:22,591 --> 02:21:23,455
No way to get 'em back.

2099
02:21:23,457 --> 02:21:25,388
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2100
02:21:25,390 --> 02:21:26,256
Hold on!

2101
02:21:27,956 --> 02:21:30,121
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2102
02:21:36,056 --> 02:21:38,421
Anyone see an ugly brown van
out there?

2103
02:21:38,423 --> 02:21:41,621
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2104
02:21:41,623 --> 02:21:44,123
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2105
02:21:45,089 --> 02:21:46,354
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

2106
02:21:46,356 --> 02:21:48,087
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2107
02:21:48,089 --> 02:21:49,723
We're on it, Cap.

2108
02:21:59,523 --> 02:22:00,555
Hey.

2109
02:22:00,557 --> 02:22:03,955
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2110
02:22:04,690 --> 02:22:06,020
Tell me this is it.

2111
02:22:06,022 --> 02:22:08,053
If I tell you what happens...

2112
02:22:08,055 --> 02:22:09,390
it won't happen.

2113
02:22:12,856 --> 02:22:14,055
You better be right.

2114
02:22:22,189 --> 02:22:23,690
It's a mess back here.

2115
02:22:24,690 --> 02:22:25,690
It's dead.

2116
02:22:26,923 --> 02:22:28,655
- What?
- It's dead.

2117
02:22:28,657 --> 02:22:30,189
I have to hot-wire it.

2118
02:22:33,055 --> 02:22:34,422
Where's Nebula?

2119
02:22:35,522 --> 02:22:36,988
She's not responding.

2120
02:22:37,289 --> 02:22:38,556
Sire...

2121
02:22:48,155 --> 02:22:49,556
Clint!

2122
02:22:51,589 --> 02:22:52,689
Give it to me.

2123
02:23:14,888 --> 02:23:18,687
You took everything from me.

2124
02:23:18,689 --> 02:23:21,286
I don't even know
who you are.

2125
02:23:21,288 --> 02:23:22,987
You will.

2126
02:23:45,121 --> 02:23:46,288
I got it!

2127
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:49,986
Activate Instant Kill.

2128
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:14,588
Rain fire!

2129
02:24:15,153 --> 02:24:17,418
But, sire, our troops!

2130
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:19,220
Just do it!

2131
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,619
<i>Uh, is anyone else
seeing this?</i>

2132
02:24:55,554 --> 02:24:56,651
I got this!

2133
02:24:56,653 --> 02:24:58,950
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

2134
02:24:58,952 --> 02:25:00,217
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

2135
02:25:00,219 --> 02:25:02,320
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2136
02:25:12,152 --> 02:25:13,386
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2137
02:25:16,886 --> 02:25:18,350
Hey!
Nice to meet you...

2138
02:25:18,352 --> 02:25:20,219
Oh, my God!

2139
02:25:56,186 --> 02:25:58,384
What the hell is this?

2140
02:25:58,386 --> 02:25:59,850
Friday,
what are they firing at?

2141
02:25:59,852 --> 02:26:01,685
<i>Something just
entered the upper atmosphere.</i>

2142
02:26:14,885 --> 02:26:17,218
Oh, yeah!

2143
02:26:36,919 --> 02:26:39,452
Danvers,
we need an assist here.

2144
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:50,717
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2145
02:26:51,418 --> 02:26:52,882
Hey, Peter Parker.

2146
02:26:52,884 --> 02:26:54,283
You got something for me?

2147
02:27:00,117 --> 02:27:02,385
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

2148
02:27:03,918 --> 02:27:05,452
Don't worry.

2149
02:27:06,350 --> 02:27:08,017
She's got help.

2150
02:29:55,514 --> 02:29:59,114
I am inevitable.

2151
02:30:19,214 --> 02:30:20,712
And I...

2152
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:23,513
am...

2153
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:28,680
Iron Man.

2154
02:32:27,145 --> 02:32:29,443
Mr. Stark?

2155
02:32:29,445 --> 02:32:31,643
Hey!

2156
02:32:31,645 --> 02:32:34,743
Mr. Stark.
Can you hear me?

2157
02:32:34,745 --> 02:32:36,378
It's Peter.

2158
02:32:37,611 --> 02:32:39,311
Hey.

2159
02:32:40,144 --> 02:32:43,378
We won, Mr. Stark.

2160
02:32:45,044 --> 02:32:47,378
We won, Mr. Stark.

2161
02:32:48,878 --> 02:32:52,109
We won! You did it, sir,
you did it.

2162
02:32:52,111 --> 02:32:54,241
I'm sorry.

2163
02:32:54,243 --> 02:32:55,243
Tony.

2164
02:33:08,778 --> 02:33:09,942
Hey.

2165
02:33:09,944 --> 02:33:12,011
Hey, Pep.

2166
02:33:16,243 --> 02:33:17,241
Friday?

2167
02:33:17,243 --> 02:33:20,243
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

2168
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:29,710
Tony?

2169
02:33:30,912 --> 02:33:32,177
Look at me.

2170
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:36,644
We're gonna be okay.

2171
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:43,310
You can rest now.

2172
02:35:28,442 --> 02:35:31,406
<i>Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?</i>

2173
02:35:31,408 --> 02:35:33,973
<i>But it doesn't always
roll that way.</i>

2174
02:35:35,842 --> 02:35:37,575
<i>Maybe this time.</i>

2175
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:41,973
<i>I'm hoping
if you play this back...</i>

2176
02:35:43,508 --> 02:35:45,773
<i>it's in celebration.</i>

2177
02:35:45,775 --> 02:35:49,840
<i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i>

2178
02:35:49,842 --> 02:35:51,373
<i>And something like
a normal version</i>

2179
02:35:51,375 --> 02:35:53,907
<i>of the planet
has been restored.</i>

2180
02:35:53,909 --> 02:35:56,338
<i>If there ever was
such a thing.</i>

2181
02:35:56,340 --> 02:36:00,305
<i>God, what a world.
Universe, now.</i>

2182
02:36:00,307 --> 02:36:02,439
<i>If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...</i>

2183
02:36:02,441 --> 02:36:04,506
<i>let alone to this extent,
I mean,</i>

2184
02:36:04,508 --> 02:36:06,505
<i>I wouldn't have
been surprised...</i>

2185
02:36:06,507 --> 02:36:08,172
<i>but come on, who knew?</i>

2186
02:36:08,174 --> 02:36:11,038
<i>The epic forces of
darkness and light</i>

2187
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:12,971
<i>that have come into play.</i>

2188
02:36:12,973 --> 02:36:14,873
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

2189
02:36:14,875 --> 02:36:16,472
<i>that's the reality
Morgan's gonna</i>

2190
02:36:16,474 --> 02:36:19,272
<i>have to find a way
to grow up in.</i>

2191
02:36:22,107 --> 02:36:23,205
<i>So, I thought I'd probably</i>

2192
02:36:23,207 --> 02:36:24,572
<i>better record
a little greeting...</i>

2193
02:36:24,574 --> 02:36:28,005
<i>in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.</i>

2194
02:36:28,007 --> 02:36:31,407
<i>Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.</i>

2195
02:36:32,374 --> 02:36:33,905
<i>This time travel thing
that we're gonna</i>

2196
02:36:33,907 --> 02:36:35,739
<i>try and pull off tomorrow...</i>

2197
02:36:35,741 --> 02:36:36,806
<i>it's got me
scratching my head</i>

2198
02:36:36,808 --> 02:36:38,037
<i>about the survivability
of it all.</i>

2199
02:36:38,039 --> 02:36:39,607
<i>That's the thing.</i>

2200
02:36:41,407 --> 02:36:43,439
<i>Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?</i>

2201
02:36:43,441 --> 02:36:44,707
<i>Part of the journey
is the end.</i>

2202
02:36:46,707 --> 02:36:47,839
<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>

2203
02:36:47,841 --> 02:36:48,970
<i>Everything is gonna work out</i>

2204
02:36:48,972 --> 02:36:52,106
<i>exactly the way
it's supposed to.</i>

2205
02:36:55,507 --> 02:36:57,239
<i>I love you 3,000.</i>

2206
02:39:11,871 --> 02:39:14,502
You know,
I wish there was a way

2207
02:39:14,504 --> 02:39:15,671
that I could let her know.

2208
02:39:18,271 --> 02:39:20,371
That we won.

2209
02:39:21,671 --> 02:39:23,438
We did it.

2210
02:39:26,904 --> 02:39:28,936
She knows.

2211
02:39:33,638 --> 02:39:35,704
They both do.

2212
02:39:44,671 --> 02:39:45,868
<i>How you doing, squirt?</i>

2213
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:47,001
Good.

2214
02:39:47,003 --> 02:39:48,402
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

2215
02:39:48,404 --> 02:39:51,702
- Good. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

2216
02:39:51,704 --> 02:39:52,704
What do you want?

2217
02:39:53,471 --> 02:39:55,003
Cheeseburgers.

2218
02:39:59,437 --> 02:40:02,168
You know, your dad
liked cheeseburgers.

2219
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:03,503
Okay.

2220
02:40:05,969 --> 02:40:07,101
I'm gonna get you

2221
02:40:07,103 --> 02:40:08,501
all the cheeseburgers
you want.

2222
02:40:08,503 --> 02:40:09,503
Okay.

2223
02:40:26,303 --> 02:40:27,834
So...

2224
02:40:27,836 --> 02:40:30,435
when can we
expect you back?

2225
02:40:31,637 --> 02:40:33,700
Um, about that...

2226
02:40:33,702 --> 02:40:35,966
Thor, your people
need a king.

2227
02:40:35,968 --> 02:40:38,068
No, they already have one.

2228
02:40:39,968 --> 02:40:41,169
That's funny.

2229
02:40:46,637 --> 02:40:48,503
Are you being serious?

2230
02:40:52,035 --> 02:40:54,901
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2231
02:40:54,903 --> 02:40:57,570
rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2232
02:40:58,803 --> 02:41:01,100
But you, you're a leader.

2233
02:41:01,102 --> 02:41:03,068
That's who you are.

2234
02:41:05,269 --> 02:41:07,367
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2235
02:41:07,369 --> 02:41:09,300
I'm counting on it...

2236
02:41:09,302 --> 02:41:10,701
Your Majesty.

2237
02:41:20,802 --> 02:41:22,169
What will you do?

2238
02:41:22,768 --> 02:41:24,233
I'm not sure.

2239
02:41:24,235 --> 02:41:26,534
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2240
02:41:26,536 --> 02:41:28,000
I have no path.

2241
02:41:28,002 --> 02:41:29,666
I do have a ride though.

2242
02:41:29,668 --> 02:41:31,699
Move it or lose it,
hairbag.

2243
02:41:36,034 --> 02:41:38,032
Oh, here we are!

2244
02:41:38,034 --> 02:41:39,668
Tree, good to see you.

2245
02:41:44,134 --> 02:41:47,900
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2246
02:41:47,902 --> 02:41:50,001
Where to first?

2247
02:41:50,902 --> 02:41:52,434
Hey.

2248
02:41:52,436 --> 02:41:54,733
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2249
02:41:54,735 --> 02:41:56,166
I'm in charge.

2250
02:41:56,168 --> 02:41:58,932
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2251
02:41:58,934 --> 02:42:00,633
Of course.

2252
02:42:03,067 --> 02:42:05,833
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2253
02:42:05,835 --> 02:42:06,932
It makes you think
that maybe

2254
02:42:06,934 --> 02:42:08,932
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2255
02:42:08,934 --> 02:42:10,533
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2256
02:42:10,535 --> 02:42:11,665
Quail?

2257
02:42:11,667 --> 02:42:12,800
Okay? I am merely trying

2258
02:42:12,802 --> 02:42:14,199
to be of service
and assisting.

2259
02:42:14,201 --> 02:42:15,499
Quill.

2260
02:42:15,501 --> 02:42:16,632
That's what I said.

2261
02:42:16,634 --> 02:42:18,965
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2262
02:42:18,967 --> 02:42:20,468
Sounds fair.

2263
02:42:23,067 --> 02:42:25,698
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

2264
02:42:25,700 --> 02:42:26,765
I got some blasters,

2265
02:42:26,767 --> 02:42:28,132
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2266
02:42:28,134 --> 02:42:30,632
Oh, yes!
Please, use knives.

2267
02:42:30,634 --> 02:42:31,832
Yeah. Knives.

2268
02:42:31,834 --> 02:42:33,468
I am Groot.

2269
02:42:39,268 --> 02:42:40,499
Not necessary.

2270
02:42:40,501 --> 02:42:42,198
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2271
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:45,401
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

2272
02:42:48,867 --> 02:42:50,233
Me.

2273
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:52,167
Right?

2274
02:42:52,901 --> 02:42:55,465
Yes, you.

2275
02:42:55,467 --> 02:42:57,931
Of course! Of course.

2276
02:42:57,933 --> 02:42:59,667
Of course.

2277
02:43:01,467 --> 02:43:03,765
Remember...

2278
02:43:03,767 --> 02:43:04,998
you have to return the stones

2279
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,131
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2280
02:43:06,133 --> 02:43:07,198
or you're gonna open up

2281
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:09,631
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2282
02:43:09,633 --> 02:43:11,064
Don't worry, Bruce.

2283
02:43:11,066 --> 02:43:13,597
Clip all the branches.

2284
02:43:13,599 --> 02:43:15,400
You know, I tried.

2285
02:43:16,434 --> 02:43:18,697
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2286
02:43:18,699 --> 02:43:21,000
I really tried
to bring her back.

2287
02:43:24,033 --> 02:43:25,932
I miss her, man.

2288
02:43:26,233 --> 02:43:27,233
Me too.

2289
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:33,633
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2290
02:43:36,099 --> 02:43:38,097
You're a good man, Sam.

2291
02:43:38,099 --> 02:43:39,932
This one's on me, though.

2292
02:43:44,099 --> 02:43:46,232
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2293
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:49,230
How can I?

2294
02:43:49,232 --> 02:43:51,266
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2295
02:43:58,733 --> 02:44:00,864
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2296
02:44:00,866 --> 02:44:02,465
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2297
02:44:09,766 --> 02:44:11,596
How long
is this gonna take?

2298
02:44:11,598 --> 02:44:14,598
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2299
02:44:19,665 --> 02:44:20,997
You ready, Cap?

2300
02:44:20,999 --> 02:44:23,532
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2301
02:44:24,266 --> 02:44:25,366
You bet.

2302
02:44:26,765 --> 02:44:28,432
Going quantum.
Three...

2303
02:44:28,899 --> 02:44:29,964
two...

2304
02:44:30,498 --> 02:44:31,665
one.

2305
02:44:33,565 --> 02:44:35,730
And returning in five...

2306
02:44:35,732 --> 02:44:36,830
four...

2307
02:44:36,832 --> 02:44:38,830
three, two...

2308
02:44:38,832 --> 02:44:40,299
one.

2309
02:44:47,498 --> 02:44:48,463
Where is he?

2310
02:44:48,465 --> 02:44:50,563
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2311
02:44:50,565 --> 02:44:52,131
He should be here.

2312
02:44:57,531 --> 02:44:58,630
Get him back.

2313
02:44:58,632 --> 02:44:59,830
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

2314
02:44:59,832 --> 02:45:01,899
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2315
02:45:25,697 --> 02:45:27,365
Go ahead.

2316
02:45:45,330 --> 02:45:46,130
Cap?

2317
02:45:48,396 --> 02:45:50,197
Hi, Sam.

2318
02:45:52,997 --> 02:45:56,230
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2319
02:45:58,130 --> 02:46:02,197
Well, after I put the stones
back, I thought...

2320
02:46:03,297 --> 02:46:04,961
maybe...

2321
02:46:04,963 --> 02:46:09,997
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2322
02:46:11,797 --> 02:46:14,097
How'd that work out
for ya?

2323
02:46:16,496 --> 02:46:18,030
It was beautiful.

2324
02:46:19,097 --> 02:46:21,195
Good. I'm happy for you.

2325
02:46:21,197 --> 02:46:22,230
Truly.

2326
02:46:22,830 --> 02:46:24,264
Thank you.

2327
02:46:25,329 --> 02:46:26,861
Only thing
bumming me out...

2328
02:46:26,863 --> 02:46:28,594
is the fact I have
to live in a world

2329
02:46:28,596 --> 02:46:30,530
without Captain America.

2330
02:46:30,996 --> 02:46:32,329
Oh.

2331
02:46:34,363 --> 02:46:37,196
That reminds me.

2332
02:46:45,596 --> 02:46:46,962
Try it on.

2333
02:47:12,362 --> 02:47:13,962
How does it feel?

2334
02:47:16,229 --> 02:47:18,196
Like it's someone else's.

2335
02:47:21,229 --> 02:47:22,362
It isn't.

2336
02:47:35,629 --> 02:47:37,295
Thank you.

2337
02:47:38,862 --> 02:47:40,294
I'll do my best.

2338
02:47:45,595 --> 02:47:47,529
That's why it's yours.

2339
02:47:49,128 --> 02:47:50,595
You wanna tell me
about her?

2340
02:47:57,261 --> 02:47:58,993
No.

2341
02:47:58,995 --> 02:48:01,294
No, I don't think I will.
